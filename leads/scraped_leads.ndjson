  "email 2": "Hi Pavel,\n\nGiving this another shot before I set it aside.\n\nAs I noted, repeating explanations in meetings and emails is unproductive.\n\nThose lost billable hours quietly drain your profits and slow down growth.\n\nThat’s why we condense the whole pitch into a whiteboard video you and your prospects can watch once and actually remember.\n\nI can put together a quick script outline this week — no strings attached.\n\nIf this isn’t up your alley, reply 'NO' and I’ll vanish.\n\nLooking forward,\n– Trent,\nToon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com/",
  "email 3": "Hi there Pavel,\n\nJust reaching out one last time to keep this top of mind.\n\nLike I pointed out earlier, repeated explanations cost far more than just time — they chip away at your billable hours and put a real dent in your revenue potential.\n\nWe build polished whiteboard videos your team can rely on—saving time and cutting out mixed messages.\n\nIf you want, I can send over a short concept.\n\nUse it or not, up to you.\n\nAll the best,\n– Trent,\nToon Theory\nhttp://www.toontheory.com/",
