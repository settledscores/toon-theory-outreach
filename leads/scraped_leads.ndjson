We help businesses like your's show what they mean; especially when it’s the kind of thing that’s tricky to summarize in one sentence.\n\nI know SF Tax and Advisory Services runs a layered, solution-based operation, which is exactly what our videos are built for: simplifying complex offers into something people understand right away.If you've ever tried to put SF Tax and Advisory Services's key offerings into words and ended up with a huge wall of text, you're not alone. We help simplify it with short, clear explainers; and we handle every step in-house, so you can just hit play.\n\nMost folks use them as evergreen explainers; handy whenever someone asks *‘so what do you do?’* They can live on your homepage, pitch decks or even newsletters.\n\nIf you’re into it, I could draft a small script or storyboard to show how this might work for you.\n\nYou’re welcome to reach out if this interests you. A few examples are included in my signature; and if not your thing, a simple 'NO' will take you off my list.\n\nThanks,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at Arch CPA takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Arch CPA who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nClients end up dropping these videos into proposals, landing pages, even training. They're really versatile.\n\nTotally optional, but I’d be glad to send over a first-pass sketch. Just to play around with.\n\nReply anytime if it feels like something you’d want to chat more about. You’ll see some past examples of our work in my signature. Totally fine to reply 'NO' if not.\n\nWarm regards,\nTrent — Founder @ Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at The Human Resource Edge takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like The Human Resource Edge who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nOnce you’ve got one of these videos, you can drop it into all sorts of places such as your homepage or even newsletters where words fail to keep up.\n\nIf you want to see what this might look like for The Human Resource Edge, I could whip up a quick snippet, say 10 seconds. Absolutely no strings\n\nYou’re free to ignore this, but if you're at all interested, reply anytime. A few past projects are mentioned below in my signature.

We help businesses like your's show what they mean; especially when it’s the kind of thing that’s tricky to summarize in one sentence.\n\nIf it takes three paragraphs to explain what you do at Practical PM, then it’s probably time for a video. We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nThis might be easier to show than tell; happy to put a no-cost sample together if you’re up for it.\n\nYou’re free to ignore this, but if you're at all interested, reply anytime. A few past projects are mentioned below in my signature. Just say 'NO' if you'd prefer no future messages.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",

If not interested, replying “NO” will stop future messages.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

Just to play around with.\n\nIf any part of this felt interesting, you can always reply. Some previous projects are listed in the signature.

Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at Nortek Solutions takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Nortek Solutions who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThese videos tend to stick around; folks re-use them in demos, sales decks, or even when onboarding new hires\n\nIf it sounds halfway interesting, I’d be glad to draw something up; just a loose draft to react to.\n\nIf this sparks even a bit of curiosity, you can reply whenever.

We use doodles and voiceover to help teams explain what they do when the message is hard to pin down.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at Safe And Trusted Canada takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Safe And Trusted Canada who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nPeople usually end up using these in more places than they expected; website, email, intros, that kind of thing.\n\nI could mock something up if you want to see how it might look like with your brand's voice behind it.\n\nReply anytime if it feels like something you’d want to chat more about.
