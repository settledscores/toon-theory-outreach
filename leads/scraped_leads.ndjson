We help businesses like your's show what they mean; especially when it’s the kind of thing that’s tricky to summarize in one sentence.\n\nI know SF Tax and Advisory Services runs a layered, solution-based operation, which is exactly what our videos are built for: simplifying complex offers into something people understand right away.If you've ever tried to put SF Tax and Advisory Services's key offerings into words and ended up with a huge wall of text, you're not alone. We help simplify it with short, clear explainers; and we handle every step in-house, so you can just hit play.\n\nMost folks use them as evergreen explainers; handy whenever someone asks *‘so what do you do?’* They can live on your homepage, pitch decks or even newsletters.\n\nIf you’re into it, I could draft a small script or storyboard to show how this might work for you.\n\nYou’re welcome to reach out if this interests you. A few examples are included in my signature; and if not your thing, a simple 'NO' will take you off my list.\n\nThanks,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",
  "email 2": "Hello Stephen,\n\nJust looping back in case this got lost in your inbox. I mentioned how whiteboard animation could support SF Tax and Advisory Services’s messaging ; and I still believe there’s a great fit here.\n\nThese videos are especially helpful when you’re trying to explain something technical, strategic, or new in a way that sticks.\n\nIf it helps, I’d be happy to put together a short script or quick teaser to show what this could look like.\n\nFeel free to reply if you’d like to explore it. You’ll find examples of our work in my signature. If it’s not a fit, feel free to reply with a quick “NO” and I won’t reach out again.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",
  "email 3": "Hey Stephen,\n\nJust reaching out again before I close this thread. If you think animated storytelling could be of value to SF Tax and Advisory Services, I would love to put something together.\n\nEven a 10-second sketch can be a useful way to explore what is possible.\n\nFeel free to reply at your convenience.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nTrusted by consultants, coaches, and businesses who care about clarity.",

We help businesses like your's show what they mean; especially when it’s the kind of thing that’s tricky to summarize in one sentence.\n\nWith so many bundled offerings and tailored services like the ones RLI Consulting provides, it’s easy for prospects to miss the point. We make videos that connect those dots instantly, and we handle everything in-house so you don't even have to lift a finger.\n\nThey’re built once, but tend to get reused in all kinds of conversations; such as your homepage, newsletters or pitch decks.\n\nAlways happy to put pen to paper. I could sketch something simple out; no strings.\n\nYou’re welcome to reach out if this interests you. A few examples are included in my signature; and if not your thing, a simple 'NO' will take you off my list.\n\nWarmly,\nTrent — Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nWhiteboard videos your customers will actually remember.",

Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nIf it takes three paragraphs to explain what you do at Tax Solutions Group, then it’s probably time for a video. We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nTeams often plug them into their homepage, newsletters, or even client onboarding kits. These videos are super dynamic.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to see how this could sound for Tax Solutions Group; happy to whip up a quick teaser, 10 seconds or so.\n\nYou can reply whenever if this seems worth exploring. There’s some past work in my signature too. Or just send 'NO' if this isn’t your thing.\n\nThanks,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nI know CFO Strategies runs a layered, solution-based operation, which is exactly what our videos are built for: simplifying complex offers into something people understand right away.If you've ever tried to put CFO Strategies's key offerings into words and ended up with a huge wall of text, you're not alone. We help simplify it with short, clear explainers; and we handle every step in-house, so you can just hit play.\n\nMost teams keep reusing them. They're really helpful on landing pages, in follow-ups, or even onboarding flows.\n\nThis might be easier to show than tell; happy to put a no-cost sample together if you’re up for it.\n\nHappy to hear from you if this caught your eye. You’ll find some examples down below if you’d like to browse; or just reply 'NO' if you’d rather not get follow-ups.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",

Or simply reply “NO” if you'd like to opt out.\n\nRegards,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",

We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at AMP Services takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like AMP Services who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThese videos are pretty low-lift; most folks use them across their homepage, email, or even onboarding.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I could put together a quick sketch or sample script; just something to see if the tone feels right.\n\nYou’re welcome to reach out if this interests you. A few examples are included in my signature; and if not your thing, a simple 'NO' will take you off my list.\n\nRespectfully,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nTrusted by consultants, coaches, and businesses who care about clarity.",

Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at The ISO Edge takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like The ISO Edge who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re quick to watch and easy to share; kind of like a visual elevator pitch you can repurpose, even on your landing pages or pitch decks.\n\nLet me know if you want a quick visual mock; no deck, no pitch, just a sketch.\n\nReply anytime if you're even a little interested; and feel free to check out some previous work in my signature.

We use doodles and voiceover to help teams explain what they do when the message is hard to pin down.\n\nThe kinds of customized, bundled services that ALA Financial Services provides usually take a paragraph or two to explain. We turn that into a 90-second video that says it better.\n\nPeople usually end up using these in more places than they expected; website, email, intros, that kind of thing.\n\nI could sketch something out if you’re curious; nothing polished, just a rough idea to react to.\n\nReply anytime if you're even a little interested; and feel free to check out some previous work in my signature. Just reply 'NO' if you'd prefer not to hear from me again.\n\nWarm regards,\nTrent — Founder @ Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

We make videos that connect those dots instantly, and we handle everything in-house so you don't even have to lift a finger.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nI could sketch something out if you’re curious; nothing polished, just a rough idea to react to.\n\nYou can reply whenever if this seems worth exploring. There’s some past work in my signature too. Or just send 'NO' if this isn’t your thing.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nWe’ve worked with teams like Sandhu & Company, CPA who have a lot going on: layered offers, custom solutions, you name it. Our videos help connect the dots without adding more work to your plate. That's because we do it all in-house, with minimal effort on your end.\n\nThese videos are pretty low-lift; most folks use them across their homepage, email, or even onboarding.\n\nThis might be easier to show than tell; happy to put a no-cost sample together if you’re up for it.\n\nHappy to hear from you if this caught your eye. You’ll find some examples down below if you’d like to browse; or just reply 'NO' if you’d rather not get follow-ups.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nTrusted by consultants, coaches, and businesses who care about clarity.",

We use doodles and voiceover to help teams explain what they do when the message is hard to pin down.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at KPMG takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like KPMG who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re quick to watch and easy to share; kind of like a visual elevator pitch you can repurpose, even on your landing pages or pitch decks.\n\nIf it sounds halfway interesting, I’d be glad to draw something up; just a loose draft to react to.\n\nReply anytime if you're even a little interested; and feel free to check out some previous work in my signature.

We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at Trowbridge Professional Corporation takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Trowbridge Professional Corporation who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThese videos are pretty low-lift; most folks use them across their homepage, email, or even onboarding.\n\nNo pressure at all; I can put together a tiny demo if it helps spark ideas.\n\nIf this sparks even a bit of curiosity, you can reply whenever. I also added a few past projects in my signature.

Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nIf it takes three paragraphs to explain what you do at Able Accident Benefits, then it’s probably time for a video. We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nMost folks use them as evergreen explainers; handy whenever someone asks *‘so what do you do?’* They can live on your homepage, pitch decks or even newsletters.\n\nHappy to send over a short teaser if you want to see what it might feel like in practice.\n\nNo rush; reply if you're even slightly interested. You can take a peek at what we’ve done before in my signature. Also say 'NO' if you don't want me to reach out again.\n\nSincerely,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nHelping you teach, pitch, and persuade in under two minutes.",

We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nWe’ve worked with teams like Spherion Staffing Solutions who have a lot going on: layered offers, custom solutions, you name it. Our videos help connect the dots without adding more work to your plate. That's because we do it all in-house, with minimal effort on your end.\n\nClients end up dropping these videos into proposals, landing pages, even training. They're really versatile.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to see how this could sound for Spherion Staffing Solutions; happy to whip up a quick teaser, 10 seconds or so.\n\nNo rush; reply if you're even slightly interested. You can take a peek at what we’ve done before in my signature. Also say 'NO' if you don't want me to reach out again.\n\nThanks,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

We draw little stories for small businesses that help cut through the noise without dumbing anything down.\n\nIf it takes three paragraphs to explain what you do at The Executive Network, then it’s probably time for a video. We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nIf you’re into it, I could draft a small script or storyboard to show how this might work for you.\n\nReply anytime if it feels like something you’d want to chat more about. You’ll see some past examples of our work in my signature.

We draw whiteboard videos to simplify what people usually need more than one paragraph to explain.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at EasyNOA takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like EasyNOA who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThese videos are simple enough to live on your homepage but clear enough for email intros and decks too.\n\nI'd be happy to mock up a small piece; maybe a 10-second snippet; to give you a sense of how this could sound.\n\nYou’re free to ignore this, but if you're at all interested, reply anytime. A few past projects are mentioned below in my signature.

We help simplify it with short, clear explainers; and we handle every step in-house, so you can just hit play.\n\nThey’re quick to watch and easy to share; kind of like a visual elevator pitch you can repurpose, even on your landing pages or pitch decks.\n\nIf you're even a little curious, I can sketch a 10-second snippet just for you to test the waters.\n\nIf this sparks even a bit of curiosity, you can reply whenever.

That’s what we do: clear videos that explain it all, zero lift on your side.\n\nThese videos tend to stick around; folks re-use them in demos, sales decks, or even when onboarding new hires\n\nThis might be easier to show than tell; happy to put a no-cost sample together if you’re up for it.\n\nReply anytime if you're even a little interested; and feel free to check out some previous work in my signature.

Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nI know Crowe Mackay runs a layered, solution-based operation, which is exactly what our videos are built for: simplifying complex offers into something people understand right away.If you've ever tried to put Crowe Mackay's key offerings into words and ended up with a huge wall of text, you're not alone. We help simplify it with short, clear explainers; and we handle every step in-house, so you can just hit play.\n\nIt’s not the kind of video you watch once and forget; most clients use them on repeat from homepages to newsletters to onboarding kits.\n\nIf you’re into it, I could draft a small script or storyboard to show how this might work for you.\n\nReply anytime if it feels like something you’d want to chat more about.

That's because we do it all in-house, with minimal effort on your end.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nNo pressure at all; I can put together a tiny demo if it helps spark ideas.\n\nNo rush; reply if you're even slightly interested.

We help businesses like your's show what they mean; especially when it’s the kind of thing that’s tricky to summarize in one sentence.\n\nWe’ve helped others businesses like KB Better Construction untangle the hard-to-summarize parts of their work. These videos let you show how all the dots connect; and we handle every part of the process so you don't even have to lift a finger.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nI could sketch something out if you’re curious; nothing polished, just a rough idea to react to.\n\nYou’re free to ignore this, but if you're at all interested, reply anytime. A few past projects are mentioned below in my signature. Just say 'NO' if you'd prefer no future messages.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",

We don’t do flashy — just clear, human videos that help small B2B teams say more with less.\n\nI know Virtual Management Group delivers bundled services that aren’t easy to summarize in one email or pitch deck. Even smart prospects can tune out if things aren’t quite framed right. These videos fix that. Our explainers do that job in under two minutes, with zero input needed on your end.\n\nClients end up dropping these videos into proposals, landing pages, even training. They're really versatile.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to see how this could sound for Virtual Management Group; happy to whip up a quick teaser, 10 seconds or so.\n\nHappy to hear from you if this caught your eye. You’ll find some examples down below if you’d like to browse; or just reply 'NO' if you’d rather not get follow-ups.\n\nRegards,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",

We don’t do flashy — just clear, human videos that help small B2B teams say more with less.\n\nIf it takes three paragraphs to explain what you do at Quarterback Communications, then it’s probably time for a video. We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re quick to watch and easy to share; kind of like a visual elevator pitch you can repurpose, even on your landing pages or pitch decks.\n\nI’d be happy to whip out a quick script or 10 second snippet if you want to see what it could look like for Quarterback Communications.\n\nYou can reply whenever if this seems worth exploring. There’s some past work in my signature too. Or just send 'NO' if this isn’t your thing.\n\nWith gratitude,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nHelping you teach, pitch, and persuade in under two minutes.",

  "email 3": "Hi John,\n\nJust circling back in case the timing makes more sense now. I still believe whiteboard animation could support something Quarterback Communications is working on, whether that is a pitch, process, or product.\n\nIf you would like to test the waters, I am happy to sketch something out to show what it might look like.\n\nYou will find past examples in my signature.

Even smart prospects can tune out if things aren’t quite framed right. These videos fix that. Our explainers do that job in under two minutes, with zero input needed on your end.\n\nThese videos tend to stick around; folks re-use them in demos, sales decks, or even when onboarding new hires\n\nIf it sounds halfway interesting, I’d be glad to draw something up; just a loose draft to react to.\n\nReply anytime if it feels like something you’d want to chat more about. You’ll see some past examples of our work in my signature.

We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nI know H&R Block Canada delivers bundled services that aren’t easy to summarize in one email or pitch deck. Even smart prospects can tune out if things aren’t quite framed right. These videos fix that. Our explainers do that job in under two minutes, with zero input needed on your end.\n\nThese videos short, punchy, and surprisingly sticky. People keep watching and re-watching. And they tend to travel well; from landing pages to pitches and everything in between.\n\nI’d be happy to whip out a quick script or 10 second snippet if you want to see what it could look like for H&R Block Canada.\n\nYou’re welcome to reach out if this interests you. A few examples are included in my signature; and if not your thing, a simple 'NO' will take you off my list.\n\nThanks,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nWith so many bundled offerings and tailored services like the ones Keystone Tax & Accounting provides, it’s easy for prospects to miss the point. We make videos that connect those dots instantly, and we handle everything in-house so you don't even have to lift a finger.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nIf you’re into it, I could draft a small script or storyboard to show how this might work for you.\n\nIf any part of this felt interesting, you can always reply. Some previous projects are listed in the signature. Or reply 'NO' and I won’t send anything else.\n\nBest wishes,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nAnimation for experts who need to sound less 'expert-y'.",

  "email 1": "Hi there Paul, Reaching out with a quick idea that might be up your alley.\n\nI’m Trent and I run an animation studio called Toon Theory. We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nThe kinds of customized, bundled services that Paul Mitassov Law provides usually take a paragraph or two to explain. We turn that into a 90-second video that says it better.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nI'd be happy to mock up a small piece; maybe a 10-second snippet; to give you a sense of how this could sound.\n\nYou can reply whenever if this seems worth exploring. There’s some past work in my signature too. Or just send 'NO' if this isn’t your thing.\n\nThanks,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",
  "email 2": "Hello Paul,\n\nI didn’t want to leave things hanging without checking in. I mentioned how whiteboard animation can be a strong complement to what Paul Mitassov Law is already doing, especially when you’re communicating ideas that needs a touch of individuality.\n\nIf it’s helpful, I can pull together a short visual sketch or sample script based on one of your key offerings.\n\nNo pressure; just a creative starting point for you to consider.\n\nYou’ll find some of our work in my signature. If it’s not for you, feel free to just reply “NO” and I’ll close the loop here.\n\nRegards,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",
  "email 3": "Hello Paul,\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I’m reaching out again to offer a creative way for Paul Mitassov Law to stand out using animated whiteboard videos.\n\nEven a short, simple animation can make complex ideas easier to understand and more engaging for your audience.\n\nIf that sounds interesting, I’d be glad to prepare a brief sketch or a script to share with you.\n\nPlease reply anytime.

We use doodles and voiceover to help teams explain what they do when the message is hard to pin down.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at Lifeworks by Morneau Shepell takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Lifeworks by Morneau Shepell who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThese videos short, punchy, and surprisingly sticky. People keep watching and re-watching. And they tend to travel well; from landing pages to pitches and everything in between.\n\nIf it sounds halfway interesting, I’d be glad to draw something up; just a loose draft to react to.\n\nYou can reply whenever if this seems worth exploring. There’s some past work in my signature too. Or just send 'NO' if this isn’t your thing.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

Our videos help connect the dots without adding more work to your plate. That's because we do it all in-house, with minimal effort on your end.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nI'd be happy to mock up a small piece; maybe a 10-second snippet; to give you a sense of how this could sound.\n\nIf any part of this felt interesting, you can always reply.

These videos let you show how all the dots connect; and we handle every part of the process so you don't even have to lift a finger.\n\nThey’re quick to watch and easy to share; kind of like a visual elevator pitch you can repurpose, even on your landing pages or pitch decks.\n\nLet me know if you want a quick visual mock; no deck, no pitch, just a sketch.\n\nIf you're curious at all, feel free to reply. There’s some previous work listed in my signature.

  "email 1": "Hi there Dianna, Reaching out with a quick idea that might be up your alley.\n\nI’m Trent. I started Toon Theory a while back. We draw whiteboard videos to simplify what people usually need more than one paragraph to explain.\n\nI know Barton Consulting delivers bundled services that aren’t easy to summarize in one email or pitch deck. Even smart prospects can tune out if things aren’t quite framed right. These videos fix that. Our explainers do that job in under two minutes, with zero input needed on your end.\n\nMost teams keep reusing them. They're really helpful on landing pages, in follow-ups, or even onboarding flows.\n\nIf you’re into it, I could draft a small script or storyboard to show how this might work for you.\n\nNo rush; reply if you're even slightly interested. You can take a peek at what we’ve done before in my signature. Also say 'NO' if you don't want me to reach out again.\n\nWarmly,\nTrent — Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nWhiteboard videos your customers will actually remember.",
  "email 2": "Hey Dianna,\n\nI wanted to circle back following my last email about using whiteboard animation at Barton Consulting. These videos can really simplify complex ideas and help you connect with your audience in a memorable way.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to put together that quick sketch or script I mentioned earlier; something tailored specifically to one of your key offerings or a new product launch, perhaps.\n\nFeel free to reply anytime. And just in case you missed it, some of our past projects are in my signature. If this isn’t your thing, replying “NO” is all it takes.\n\nThanks,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",
  "email 3": "Hi Dianna,\n\nI just wanted to check in again and see if the idea of using whiteboard animation for Barton Consulting has sparked any interest. Animation can be a great way to highlight key messages and bring stories to life in a memorable way.\n\nIf you'd like, I can put together a simple draft or a short sample video to show how this could work for you.\n\nYou can also find examples of our previous work in my signature. Please don’t hesitate to reply if you want to explore this.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nTeams like Advanced Credentials that deliver bundled, multi-layered offerings often need help showing how it all fits together. That’s what we do: clear videos that explain it all, zero lift on your side.\n\nPeople usually end up using these in more places than they expected; website, email, intros, that kind of thing.\n\nNo pressure at all; I can put together a tiny demo if it helps spark ideas.\n\nReply anytime if you're even a little interested; and feel free to check out some previous work in my signature. Just reply 'NO' if you'd prefer not to hear from me again.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",
  "email 2": "Hi Celeste,\n\nI didn’t want to leave things hanging without checking in. I mentioned how whiteboard animation can be a strong complement to what Advanced Credentials is already doing, especially when you’re communicating ideas that needs a touch of individuality.\n\nIf it’s helpful, I can pull together a short visual sketch or sample script based on one of your key offerings.\n\nNo pressure; just a creative starting point for you to consider.\n\nYou’ll find some of our work in my signature. If it’s not for you, feel free to just reply “NO” and I’ll close the loop here.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",

We help businesses like your's show what they mean; especially when it’s the kind of thing that’s tricky to summarize in one sentence.\n\nIf it takes three paragraphs to explain what you do at Resonance, then it’s probably time for a video. We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nThese videos short, punchy, and surprisingly sticky. People keep watching and re-watching. And they tend to travel well; from landing pages to pitches and everything in between.\n\nI could sketch something out if you’re curious; nothing polished, just a rough idea to react to.\n\nYou can reply whenever if this seems worth exploring. There’s some past work in my signature too. Or just send 'NO' if this isn’t your thing.\n\nSincerely,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nHelping you teach, pitch, and persuade in under two minutes.",
