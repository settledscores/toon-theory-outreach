Our Values Empathy Communication Personability Organization Dependability about me I m Vanessa, your personal recruiter . As an HR professional of 22 years and a proud mom, I m on a mission to bring back the human touch that s been missing in recruitment for far too long. My approach is simple: I communicate. I chat with clients, provide empathy to candidates, and always follow up to keep the conversation flowing. Similar to many of us, I was a job seeker once. I know what it s like to have limited information given to you, waiting for a response, and the gut-wrenching feeling of not getting the job. And that s where On the Go HR comes in. Great vision without great people is irrelevant. more about On the Go HR, what it means to me. I created this business to redefine the role of recruiters and help businesses level up their hiring game. Beyond my professional endeavors, my priority is being a mom. Creating On the Go HR was about prioritizing flexibility to be present for my family a lesson learned through the loss of my good friend and colleague, as well as my dad. It s a realization that in the workplace, we are replaceable. Over the past 3 years, I ve built meaningful relationships with clients, made dreams come true for candidates, and challenged the stereotypes surrounding recruiters. And you know what, I m just getting started! My ongoing mission focuses on advocating for flexibility, communication, and empathy in every workplace interaction. Ready to explore Our Services?

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think On The Go HR could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick.

Just a sketch or script; no pressure, no pitch; just curious to see what it might sound like in your voice.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring.

We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas.

Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how to optimize job postings for better candidate attraction\n• Explaining the importance of employer branding in talent acquisition\n• Demonstrating how to use data-driven insights to improve hiring decisions\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nHow about a quick sample built around Radancy's strengths? Ten seconds or so, no strings, no commitments. Just a feeler to see what resonates.\n\nYou’ll find a link to our site in my signature if you’d like to see a few examples. And if anything clicks, I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks for leading with both heart and strategy.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

I mentioned how whiteboard animation could support Radancy’s messaging ; and I still believe there’s a great fit here.\n\nThese videos are especially helpful when you’re trying to explain something technical, strategic, or new in a way that sticks.\n\nIf it helps, I’d be happy to put together a short script or quick teaser to show what this could look like.\n\nFeel free to reply if you’d like to explore it.

  "email 1": "Hi Zache,\n\nI came across DESIRE & COMPANY CPAs recently and wanted to reach out directly.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor DESIRE & COMPANY CPAs, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Demonstrating how to set up a computerized accounting system\n• Explaining the benefits of internal control reviews and risk assessments\n• Walking through the process of preparing a pre-audit report\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nIf you're curious, I could draft a ten-second teaser or sketch based on what DESIRE & COMPANY CPAs offers. Nothing formal. Just something you can react to, no strings or expectations.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to take this further. You can check out some of our work through the link in my signature as well.\n\nKeep doing what you do, it's making an impact.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nIncentive Services has a strong foundation, and a short animated video could be a powerful way to bring your message to life. We’ll take care of the full creative lift: script, voice, and illustrations, so you can use it for:\n\n• Showing how to redeem award points for travel incentives\n• Demonstrating how to customize merchandise incentives for employees\n• Explaining the benefits of non-cash incentive rewards\n\nClients often tell us these pieces help reduce bloat, increase clarity, and lead to more meaningful conversions.\n\nI’d be glad to pull together a short demo; maybe a script or quick sketch; based on what Incentive Services does best. No pressure, just a chance to preview what it might look and sound like.\n\nJust reach out if you’d like to continue the conversation.

Additional Savings Tax Planning Session Tax Planning Session Customers who sign-up for tax planning will save 25% on tax preparation fees. We want to make sure that we help you see the savings through! FAQs Tax Planning Session FAQs Want to know what the process is like? See our FAQ! FAQs FAQs Frequently Asked Questions What should I expect in a Tax Planning Session? Clients should expect two meetings and some homework during the tax planning phase. The first meeting will be an overview of the process, the outline of the tasks, and an agreement to move forward. This is followed by a working session where we review last year's taxes, current year financial results, current year financial forecasts (or provide some guestimates). Often we can provide a questionnaire that the client can fill out in advance that will make the working session go faster. Then finally, we will prepare and present expected savinigs along with an implementatiion plan for making those savings happen. How much time should I plan on this? That's a good question. However, the real question is how much time is $10,000 or more in saviings worth to you? We typically say that clients should expect between 5 and 10 hours to complete the process as inputs to the preparation of the plan. If we save you $10,000 (often a lot more) and you spent 10 hours working on it - that would be $1,000 an hour! What if there are no significant savings? Every client worries that there will be no savings. It is rare and it does happen. If we can't find any savings, then there is no charge for the review. Its that simple. Are the savings a one-time saving? Sometimes yes, but often they are recurring annually - which means they re-occur every. Clients love finding annual savings - its like giving them a pay raise! Is this confidential? Absolutely. We are fearce about protecting our clients and their condifentiality. We treat you the way we expect to be treated.

I was lost with accounting specific to my work industry. I randomly found her contact info and read where some of her clients she worked for were mortgage brokers like myself. I emailed Julianne and asked her for some advice on content. She was generous and quick with her response I would recommend her any day! Quintin Pierce It is a real pleasure working with Financial Foothold, starting from the Founder Julianne, and onboarding specialist Dennice. It has really helped our business during the start-up phase and we look forward to working with them as we grow. Mark Raizen My tax and bookkeeping providers retired and I found myself without professional accountants going into tax season. I met Julianne Autry many years ago and contacted her for a referral. Lucky for me, Financial Foothold was able to take on my small business, tidying up my Quickbooks online and helped me close out my business for 22! A CPA referral has worked seamlessly and my S corporation return is now in process.My company is tiny but I was treated kindly, professionally and quickly! I recommend highly. Leif Anders We have been with Financial Foothold and Julianne for many years now and she has always gone above and beyond to help us with our business. Julianne treats her clients like friends so every interaction with Financial Foothold is enjoyable. She is so responsive with whatever you need. Small businesses have unique needs at times, and JA is always there to help us through it. The professionals that work for her and Financial Foothold are the exact same. We have had the pleasure of working with Shelby since she has taken over our account and daily needs. Shelby is outstanding. She responds to every need lightening fast with an awesome attitude and energy. I cannot possibly give any individual or firm that provides services for small businesses a better recommendation. We feel very fortunate to work with the great people of Financial Foothold. Special thanks to JA and Shelby! RD Straface Such a pleasure working with Julianne and Dennice.

Here are eight methods to help you remedy your tax issues. Installment Contract If you find yourself unable to meet your tax obligations due to financial constraints, you may consider applying for a status known as Currently Not Collectible (CNC). This designation informs the IRS that, at present, you lack the means to settle your tax liabilities. It s imperative to include thorough documentation demonstrating your financial incapacity to repay the debts; failure to do so could result in denial of your request 2. Installment Agreement for Partial Payment If you re unable to manage a short-term tax installment plan, you have the option to negotiate for a partial payment installment arrangement. This allows you to make payments in smaller increments over time. It s important to note that there s usually a maximum timeframe of around ten years for such arrangements. Given the unconventional nature of this payment method and the importance of maintaining a positive relationship with the IRS, consulting with your settlement and resolution officer is advisable to avoid potential IRS assessments. 3. At this time, not collectible If you re burdened with a significant backlog of unpaid taxes, opting for an installment agreement can help you divide the amount into more manageable payments. This approach simplifies the process and alleviates the stress associated with making a large lump-sum payment. By establishing a monthly payment schedule, you can effectively manage your tax obligations over time. 4. Innocent Spouse You can prevent the transfer of tax liability from one spouse to another by filing as an innocent spouse. It s unjust for one spouse to bear responsibility for the other s tax debt, particularly if it predates the marriage. Filing as an innocent spouse provides a means to protect yourself from undue financial burden in such circumstances. 5. In-Compromise Offer If you re unable to settle your entire tax liability due to financial constraints, you have the option to submit an Offer in Compromise (OIC) form. This form notifies the IRS that, while you re willing to pay a reduced amount, you lack the means to pay the full tax bill. Similar to the CNC form, you must substantiate your inability to pay the debt in full with supporting documentation. Upon acceptance of the form, you re required to provide updated financial statements monthly. It s important to note that once your income surpasses the OIC cutoff, you ll be expected to resume paying the full amount. 6. Expired Returns Filing your tax return after the deadline can result in additional fees or interest assessments. However, you can swiftly address this issue by submitting a past-due return form. By doing so, you may qualify for a tax refund on any overpaid amounts, potentially providing additional savings. 7. Penalty Reduction If you ve incurred any type of tax penalty, you have the option to apply for an abatement to reduce or completely eliminate the fines.

This being the first time getting my taxes done as an adult I was nervous and really had no idea where to start. After a couple minutes of being on the phone l felt confident that I made the right decision. They not only answered all my questions, as stupid as they may have been, but they also took the time to help me understand the process. I feel confident I got the best possible refund. They were also flexible to my somewhat crazy schedule. Thank you for such great service!

We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think Amity One Tax could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Walking through the tax preparation process step-by-step\n• Explaining how the IRS Fresh Start Program works\n• Demonstrating how to resolve back taxes with confidence\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nIf you're curious, I could draft a ten-second teaser or sketch based on what Amity One Tax offers. Nothing formal. Just something you can react to, no strings or expectations.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring. In the meantime, you can view a few past projects via the link in my signature.\n\nThanks for putting something refreshing out there.\n\nSincerely,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Hey there Chris,\n\nJust circling back. I realize it can be tricky to see how something like whiteboard animation fits into a business like Amity One Tax, which is why I’d love to show rather than tell.\n\nIf you’d be open to a 10-second snippet or a short script tailored to one of your core offerings, I’d be glad to share.\n\nIt’s no obligation, just a way to explore what this could look like in your context.\n\nYou’ll find some of our past work linked in my signature.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

Located in Merrillville, Indiana, our second location was in downtown Chicago. We wanted a professional office with a more neighborhood feel that is accessible to our south side Chicago clients. When University CoWork opened last year, we immediately closed our expensive downtown office and got a $95 flexible membership, and then upgraded to a $295 dedicated desk. This allows us to do occasional work on the south side of Chicago. We now have a professional presence, and can meet our clients at our office closer to where they work and live. I love the phone and meeting rooms. Great technology. We are able to offer our clients parking and coffee in our beautiful new space. Our firm also hosts investment events in the University CoWork boardroom, classroom, and event spaces. Sharon Mallory CEO, SDM Investments Every aspect of University CoWork is superb! Since moving to Woodlawn in 2007, I have searched for suitable local office space for my law firm. I was happy to learn about University CoWork last year and eager to see the space and its amenities. The private offices, co-working spaces and common areas were all thoughtfully designed and built with highest quality finishes. University CoWork also offers far more than just professional office space. University CoWork is a welcoming community that monthly hosts networking and small business development programs and other events. I feel fortunate to be part of this vibrant community and urge those looking for local office space to visit University CoWork. Andrea Vag Managing Attorney, Vag Law LLC David Lubin was key to my expansion from a Chicago design firm to a branded North American design firm. He helped me acquire national and international clients during the most difficult business environment since the Great Depression. University CoWork helped me maintain consistent work during the pandemic, even during a pandemic construction depression in our territory. He propelled me to engage remote workers in the U.S. and abroad to keep my business growing despite the severe shortage of labor in the Chicago area. As other service businesses contracted, David s encouragement propelled me to leverage our tech stack, deep and unique subject matter expertise, and international contacts to prosper in uncertain times.

  "email 1": "Hi Scott,\n\nI came across Sanguine Strategic Advisors recently and thought there could be an opportunity to collaborate.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Sanguine Strategic Advisors, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how to optimize marketing budgets for maximum ROI\n• Demonstrating how to increase online visibility through social media\n• Explaining the benefits of SEO for small business owners\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nI’d love to put together a quick concept; maybe a script or a short teaser; around one of your key offerings. No strings, just a preview of what's possible with Sanguine Strategic Advisors's voice behind it.\n\nIf you’re curious about what this might look like, just reach out.

It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Wise Advances, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Demonstrating how to use accounting software to track expenses\n• Walking through the application process for a merchant cash advance\n• Explaining how to choose the right business credit card\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to share a quick demo built around something Wise Advances offers. Just a sketch or script; no pressure, no pitch; just curious to see what it might sound like in your voice.\n\nJust reach out if you’d like to continue the conversation. You’ll find a few previous projects linked in the signature below.\n\nThanks for putting something refreshing out there.\n\nBest wishes,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Hey Jacob,\n\nI wanted to circle back following my last email about using whiteboard animation at Wise Advances. These videos can really simplify complex ideas and help you connect with your audience in a memorable way.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to put together that quick sketch or script I mentioned earlier; something tailored specifically to one of your key offerings or a new product launch, perhaps.\n\nFeel free to reply anytime. And just in case you missed it, some of our past projects are linked in my signature.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 3": "Good day Jacob,\n\nJust circling back in case the timing makes more sense now. I still believe whiteboard animation could support something Wise Advances is working on, whether that is a pitch, process, or product.\n\nIf you would like to test the waters, I am happy to sketch something out to show what it might look like.\n\nYou will find past examples linked in my signature.

Save Money On Your Investments Cost Segregation It is important to know what goes into Cost Segregation Studies. Engineering-Based Cost Segregation is the IRS-approved method for accelerating building depreciation for commercial and residential rental properties. A proper Engineering-Based Cost Segregation study identifies what should be correctly classified as tangible personal property or land improvements rather than real property, depreciated over 39 years (or 27.5 years for residential rental property). This means that all types of investment properties may qualify for a cost segregation study. Our Cost Segregation Process A High Level Overview We send you a proposal, and you approve it. We gather information on the property. A cost segregation specialist will conduct a site visit. We do all take-offs and costing. We assemble and deliver the final detailed report. Engineering-Based Vs. Residual Studies Our engineering-based cost segregation studies are far better than the residual studies most other companies perform. See What Makes Us Different! We go the extra mile for our clients by providing complete detail for both the short-life and long-life building components. This offers multiple benefits: It allows for the reconciliation of all project costs, as required by the IRS, keeping you safe in the event of an audit. It gives our clients and tax professionals the ability to track and retire short and long-life building components that are removed from service. Your tax benefits begin in the first tax year and continue throughout the identified assets depreciable life. As long as you own your property, an M&E Cost Segregation Study will continue to provide tax benefits every time a building component is replaced/taken out of service. Find Out How You Can Save on Your Taxes With M&E Cost Segregation Get a no-cost, no-obligation estimate to start your cost segregation study journey! Request a Proposal Our Engineers have completed thousands of cost segregation studies in countless situations. New Acquisition Studies/Purchase Price Allocations Suppose you recently purchased or are planning to purchase an existing property. In that case, we can help make your new acquisition more affordable by conducting an Engineering Based Cost Segregation study for the property. This will enable specific building components to be reclassified as tangible personal property or land improvements that can be depreciated over 5, 7, or 15 years rather than real property that is depreciated over 39 years (27.5 years for residential rental property). Due to the shorter recovery periods and accelerated depreciation methods, items reclassified as tangible personal property and land improvements generate faster depreciation write-offs, thus increasing your cash flow. Our Cost Segregation experts will also assign a depreciable life and a project cost to every component within the property. This will give you the ability to write off short and long-life assets that are retired in the years following the study. New Construction Studies No matter what phase you are at with your new construction project, it is beneficial to conduct an Engineering-Based Cost Segregation Study to minimize taxes and maximize ROI. Contact us today. Look-Back Studies Even if you purchased your property several years ago, you still have the ability to conduct a cost segregation study and receive the benefits of your investment in the current tax year. It can be greatly beneficial if you have owned the property for ten years or less. Leasehold Improvement Studies An Engineering Based Cost Segregation Study can be incredibly beneficial if you lease your space but have made leasehold improvements of $500,000 or more (or plan to in the future). M&E Cost Segregation can conduct an initial evaluation based on some basic information and prepare a cost vs. benefit analysis to lay out the expected tax benefits and the fixed fees required to complete the study. Then you can make an educated decision on whether to go forward with the analysis. Have You Replaced Any Structural Components of Your Building?

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think Savvy Bird Consulting could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Walking through QuickBooks setup for new users\n• Explaining online course material in an engaging way\n• Demonstrating bookkeeping best practices for small businesses\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nCould I sketch something out for you? A short demo or script idea based on what Savvy Bird Consulting offers.

We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Pendleton Tax & Accounting Services, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how to reconcile bank and credit card accounts\n• Explaining the importance of reviewing receivables and payables\n• Walking through the process of generating monthly financial statements\n\nClients often tell us these pieces help reduce bloat, increase clarity, and lead to more meaningful conversions.\n\nIf you're curious, I could draft a ten-second teaser or sketch based on what Pendleton Tax & Accounting Services offers. Nothing formal. Just something you can react to, no strings or expectations.\n\nI’d be happy to chat if you’re interested.

Click here to go directly to the contact form What People Are Saying Client Reviews My experience with Justin Sundberg started a couple of years ago when I needed an Estate Tax return done in a time crunch situation. With very short notice, Justin was able to have it done prior to the needed date. Since that time I ve discuss business situations/the tax implications thereof with Justin and had tax returns, both personal and estate, done by him. I like the fact that he does his research well, if there is any question and/or options available, he takes the time and effort to verify the correct options and then fully explain them to you. Justin has the skill of listening, a skill that I ve found not all accountants have, and a trait that I find critical if one is going to discuss complicated financial matters. I ve found Justin reliable, thoughtful, timely, accurate and very professional as I trust you will also. | Source George E. | Executive & Venture Capitalist (but a private person, so off the grid) Justin has been such a godsend. Between starting a small business in 2009 and getting married, my tax situation was complicated. He found errors on my 2009 return, amended it, AND found a way to accelerate some overhead expenses to increase my deductions. He has saved me and my husband a LOT of money and is always looking for ways that I can improve my bookkeeping. I also like his paperless capabilities, as we can send tax documents electronically and securely. If you want a responsive, well-qualified CPA who provides high quality work for a fair price, call Justin! | Source Dr. Barb Kaiser | Doctor of chiropractic, focused on neurospinal correction Working with Justin is always an informative experience. He is committed to sharing his knowledge, money-saving business tips, and expertise as a way of supporting his clients, prospective clients, and his peers. In an otherwise \"dry\" field of work, Justin has a way of providing tough information in a light, fun way. I enjoy Justin's professionalism and depend on his deep knowledge of the tax system. | Source KimAileen White, MA | HR Support | Customized Outplacement | Job Transition Justin is my go-to CPA for start-up and small business needs. He should be yours as well. Justin is as personable as he is professional. I recommend Justin to friends and family without hesitation. | Source David J. Holt | Healthcare & Business Attorney | Patient Advocate | Entrepreneur | Cofounder at miVoyce.com Justin Sundberg, at Sundberg Tax and Consulting, provides excellent professional services. I have been impressed with Justin's depth of expertise and knowledge regarding small business finances and tax preparation. Furthermore, Justin combines that expertise with his strong drive for customer service and warm people skills. As a client, Justin built my knowledge-base, put me at ease, and gave me clear directions and responses to quickly address complicated issues. Justin's top notch service, genuine and kind personality and his work ethic have earned my loyalty and my recommendation. | Source Jo Miller, GPC, CSMS | Grant Professional Certified - Federal Grants and Nonprofit Consultant We hired Justin to help with our business Taxes last year and Justin brought a wealth of experience to the table. He was extremely responsive about all our questions, took his time to understand our needs, and made a huge effort to make sure we were happy with the process. We highly recommend his work and will continue to use his services! | Source Fuyei Xaykaothao | Associate Director of Programming Development and Partnerships at Saint Paul Urban Tennis Justin is a fantastic accountant who has taken so much stress out of running my own business. I rely on him for sound accounting advice and direction. He's incredibly knowledgeable and trustworthy. And he's fun to work with - how often do you hear that about an accountant?? HIGHLY recommend him! | Source Jennifer Dunn | Experienced Realtor and Public Policy Consultant/Researcher I was referred to Justin to help settle an IRS dispute. Hiring him has paid dividends over and over. Not only did he save me 50% on the five digit tax bill, but he also reviewed and cleaned up all my previous years returns, restructured my business to an S-Corp, and now he takes care of my book keeping and payroll.

Socials: bottom of page Finding A Good Accountant | Staten Island NY | Marocola Elite Solutions Inc top of page Finding a Good Accountant Who Understands Your Business While there is no shortage of accountants in the world, not all accountants are created equal. Every business is different, and you need to be sure that your accountant properly understands the needs of your business if you want to be successful. Outsourcing your bookkeeping is a big risk. You can t do everything by yourself and at some point, you ll likely need a professional to manage your books so you can focus on more important matters. But you can trust just anyone with that responsibility. Here are a few tips on finding a good accountant who will help you succeed: Find an accountant who understands your industry: Every industry is different and not all accountants are fit to understand the nuances of every business. An accountant with experience primarily in real estate may not be the best to handle a restaurant and vice versa. It s important to look for a tax professional with experience in your industry or at least an understanding of what is needed. Find an accountant who understands your tax needs: No two businesses are the same and to find a good accountant you ll have to know what kinds of tax services you need. If you are a company with 50 employees, you will need an accountant who understands payroll tax. If you re a solopreneur who travels extensively, you will need someone adept at tracking expenses and calculating possible deductions. You will likely need a variety of services from your accountant and it s best to have a handle on what you need before seeking out a professional. Find an accountant you trust on a personal level: You don t have to be best friends, but it s important to find an accountant you feel you can trust. You should at very least have a good report with your CPA because you ll be communicating with them a lot. If you have to grit your teeth every time you make a phone call, it s wise to look for someone else. Finding a good accountant when outsourcing your bookkeeping is tough, but not impossible. Give us a call at Marocola Elite Solutions if you want to expedite the process and book a consultation with a team of accountants who will check all these boxes. bottom of page Small Business Accountant Near Me | Staten Island NY | Marocola Elite Solutions top of page Small Business Accountant Near Me The Best Small Business Accountant Near You Proper accounting is vital to the success of any business.

FHA/VA/Jumbo/ Reduced Documentation To meet our client s diverse needs, we offer multiple loan programs to find you the best fit. Simplifying the Denver Home Loan Process We Provide Denver Mortgage Loans With A Personal Touch We know the loan process can feel overwhelming, but the Hunter Lending home mortgage team will explain the process and answer any questions you may have during any step along the way. There are six main steps in the home loan process. 1. Pre-qualification: We gather information about your credit, income, and assets to make a financial determination about how much house you may be able to afford. If you are refinancing the loan on your existing home, then the pre-qualification process should help you decide whether refinancing will help meet your financial goals. At this time, we will discuss various fees and down payment options. 2. Application: Once you find a home to purchase or determine you would like to refinance a current property, you will complete a mortgage application for a customized loan program and supply all of the required documentation for underwriting. Apply Today 3. Underwriting: The underwriter will determine whether the application package prepared by Hunter Lending has all the required information. Once the underwriter initially approves the loan, our processors will work with you to meet all requirements for final loan approval. Read More 4. Processing: Hunter Lending will order the appraisal (if needed), title, and homeowners insurance and compile the other items required to move the loan to close 5. Closing: After final loan approval, Hunter Lending will review the loan settlement figures with you and coordinate the signing of the closing documents with the title company. We will also discuss options for supplying any cash due at closing (cashier s check vs. wire) and signing location (at the title company vs. remotely at the location of your choosing). 6. Post Closing: Hunter Lending will keep you aware of interest rate fluctuations and possible cost savings with refinancing or new loan programs. Our commitment to you does not end with a loan closing. We strive to make sure you know future opportunities to better reach your financial goals.

I d recommend them to anyone looking for help with buying or investing in their home. Devin Harper I used these guys for my first home loan, and two subsequent refis. Each time I shopped around, and they got me the best rates of anyone EVERYTIME. They make the process so damn easy, it s hard to want to go anywhere else. After this last refi, I don t believe I ll be wasting my time with anyone else. Bravo gentlemen A+++ Jake Dine We have worked with Ryan and Jim at Hunter Lending now two times.

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nHunter Lending has a strong foundation, and a short animated video could be a powerful way to bring your message to life. We’ll take care of the full creative lift: script, voice, and illustrations, so you can use it for:\n\n• Explaining the benefits of FHA loans for first-time homebuyers\n• Walking through the loan pre-approval process step-by-step\n• Demonstrating how to refinance a mortgage to lower monthly payments\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to share a quick demo built around something Hunter Lending offers.

We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Lanphier Accounting, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Explaining accounting software integration for new clients\n• Walking through tax return preparation for small business owners\n• Demonstrating how to navigate complex legal compliance regulations\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nCould I sketch something out for you?

  "email 1": "Hi Jeff,\n\nI came across LoomView Enterprises recently and wanted to reach out directly.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor LoomView Enterprises, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Walking through the process of evaluating team-building skills for business success\n• Showing how to build a sales team that drives revenue growth\n• Explaining how to control costs and conserve cash for sustainable profits\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nWould you be open to seeing a quick script or ten-second sketch built with LoomView Enterprises in mind? No expectations; just interested in showing you what’s possible.\n\nIf it feels like a fit, you can reply any time.

We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Yellow Brick Road Consulting, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Demonstrating a step-by-step approach to strategic planning\n• Showing how to facilitate effective meetings and retreats\n• Explaining the benefits of experiential learning for team growth\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nI could pull together a quick sketch or sample script based on one of Yellow Brick Road Consulting’s core offerings.

Not everyone has the vision and drive required to successfully take a concept and bring it to life. And the thought of hiring external staff, like a bookkeeper, can feel a bit daunting. Early on, when you re just starting out, it s manageable to track everything yourself or use basic software. But as your business grows, you might find that managing all those invoices, payments, and expenses becomes overwhelming, explains Steven Kibbel, certified financial planner and founder of Kibbel Financial . I ve seen small business owners who wait too long to address this and end up with errors in their books, missing payments to vendors, or even misreporting revenue. SEE ALSO: The 20 best tools for starting your own business Sure, you might pride yourself on running a lean business, but a good bookkeeper should be seen as an investment, one that helps you track and retain more of your hard-earned money and frees up your time to focus on what you re best at. If you ve been wondering whether or not you need outside help to track and manage your small business expenses and income, you ll want to read on. Here are the tell-tale signs that it might be time to hire a bookkeeper, according to a certified financial planner and a small business tax advisor. 1. When you re unable to keep track of the inflow and outflow of cash As your business grows, managing your own books can quickly become overwhelming. You might lose track of who owes you money, miss vendor invoice deadlines, and struggle to accurately track cash flow, says Alex Cook, VP of Small Business Tax at Block Advisor . Reliable cash flow management is crucial for making informed business decisions that ensure long-term success. However, if bookkeeping isn't your strength, it can hinder your progress. According to Cook, untangling financial messes on your own can consume valuable time that could be better spent on sales and revenue generation. If this sounds familiar, it might be time to outsource your accounting to a trusted provider. 2. When bookkeeping starts eating into your time Another big trigger is when bookkeeping starts eating into the time you should be spending on running and growing your business. I worked with a client who owned a small retail shop, and she told me she was staying up until midnight every night trying to reconcile her accounts. That s time she could have spent sourcing new inventory or marketing her business, explains Kibbel. Hiring a book",

  "email 1": "Hi Lynette,\n\nI came across Human Resource Advantage recently and wanted to reach out directly.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Human Resource Advantage, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how to navigate complex employee relations issues\n• Walking through the process of creating effective employee handbooks\n• Explaining the importance of thorough background checks\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nI'd be happy to draft a ten-second demo around something core to your brand. Totally low-lift, just keen to explore what this could look like with Human Resource Advantage's voice behind it.\n\nReply anytime if you'd like to talk more about this. There’s also a link below with some samples of what we’ve done before.\n\nThanks for leading with both heart and strategy.\n\nSincerely,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Hi there Lynette,\n\nI didn’t want to leave things hanging without checking in. I mentioned how whiteboard animation can be a strong complement to what Human Resource Advantage is already doing, especially when you’re communicating ideas that needs a touch of individuality.\n\nIf it’s helpful, I can pull together a short visual sketch or sample script based on one of your key offerings.\n\nNo pressure; just a creative starting point for you to consider.\n\nYou’ll find some of our work linked in my signature.\n\nWith appreciation,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 3": "Hey there Lynette,\n\nJust wanted to follow up to see if you’ve had a chance to consider using whiteboard animation at Human Resource Advantage.\n\nIt’s a creative way to bring your ideas to life and connect with your audience more effectively.\n\nIf you’re interested, I’d be happy to share a quick demo or script tailored to your needs.\n\nYou’ll find past examples linked in my signature.

  "email 1": "Hi Joseph,\n\nI came across My HR Professionals recently and thought there could be an opportunity to collaborate.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think My HR Professionals could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Walking through the process of setting up a new employee benefits package\n• Explaining how to navigate the web-based time-keeping system for employees\n• Demonstrating the benefits of outsourcing payroll services\n\nClients often tell us these pieces help reduce bloat, increase clarity, and lead to more meaningful conversions.\n\nI'd be more than happy to whip up a quick snippet; a short script or sketch; that speaks to what My HR Professionals does best. No commitments at all, just a chance to show you what's possible.\n\nJust reach out if you’d like to continue the conversation.

We do and will continue to recommend Christina Hageny and Valor Payroll Solutions to our friends and colleagues. Capable, trustworthy and unparallel customer service! Tony G. Highly highly recommend. Valor is extremely professional and quick to answer any of my questions. I love that I have the ability to input hours and I am able to add employees easily.

After paying employees over 4 years I feel like I have such a better handle & understanding of payroll than I ever have. Thanks to Christina and her team. 5 stars! Whitney V.

Accounting Services Accounting Services It s a fact: Working with a business advisor dramatically increases the odds of success for your business. And with 50% of businesses failing in their first five years (Source: SBA), it just makes good business sense to find ways to increase your chances of success with your business. Finding the Perfect Blend of Accounting Skills and Expertise Every business is different when it comes to the type and level of accounting services needed. Some small businesses may only need bookkeeping services, while others benefit from many layers of accounting skills from bookkeepers to Chief Financial Officers. If your business is in the small to mid-market range, it may not make sense to have a full-time CFO, a full-time controller, and multiple bookkeepers with all the full-time salaries and benefits in your accounting department. The good news is you can still get the advice of these high-level accounting skill sets while paying only for what you need. We work with business owners like you to create a customized package based on your company s unique accounting needs. How We Can Help Your Business Accounting System Selection Having the right accounting system can make all the difference in the world. We re familiar with many accounting software options and can help you find the best fit for your business. If you ve outgrown your current solution, we can help you manage the transition without missing a beat. One secret in boosting accounting productivity is to make sure your accounting software is set up and customized correctly. We learn your requirements so we can tailor the accounting software to your business and reporting needs. Plus, we can train your staff on the new system so they can be up and running in no time. Accounting System Selection, Setup, Customization and Training Workflow Efficiencies Streamlined data gathering and entry Process Development and Improvement The accounting function is necessary in every business, but it shouldn t be cumbersome or inefficient. We can take a look at areas within your accounting system that are costing you more than they should be. These could include areas of duplicate data entry, time spent on manual reports, and bottlenecks in general. We ll suggest improvements that can save you time and money and keep your bookkeeping bill as low as possible. Are there any areas in your accounting functions that are undocumented? We can help you write a procedures manual for those areas. Good documentation is the key to good training, consistency, and controls. Let Hughes Walker Group suggest efficiency recordkeeping workflows for some of these key elements of your business: Invoicing & sales receipts Expenses & expense reporting Payroll Accounting controls Profitability Analysis Do you wonder which product or service line is the most profitable for you? We can perform an analysis of profitability by location, product, employee, or whatever grouping is meaningful for you. This information will help you make better decisions about your revenue mix and make your business more profitable in the long term. While most accountants stick to cursory expense reviews, we prefer to go deeper. We can help you identify costs that may be outside your industry norms, discover areas where your pricing might not cover your costs, and root out profit margins that should be higher. If you maintain inventory in your business, we can help you lower carrying costs, determine out-of-stock conditions, and identify obsolete items. Is your business project-based with job costing requirements? We can help you make sure it s set up right, help you create more accurate estimates, and accelerate cash flow with timely progress billings. We go beyond traditional services by providing: Monthly financial reports (Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow) Regular business reviews (Either monthly, quarterly, or annual) Industry related key performance indicators to call attention to financial issues and inconsistencies Cash flow projections Loan package creation Budgeting and forecasting Profitability Analysis Committed to the Relationship It can be difficult to find advice when you are in business for yourself. As a fellow small business owner, we can act as a sounding board for your business ideas and provide a fresh, experienced perspective. We can serve as an unbiased listener for your ideas and concerns. There are so many benefits to hiring a bookkeeping company to take care of your books. Peace of mind Relief Better business insight Tax time is a little less taxing More profits Focus How to Get Started How to Get Started The perfect synergy between a business owner and the accounting team occurs when two things happen: 1) the team gains a deeper knowledge about your specific business, and 2) the business owner grows in their financial knowledge about their business. This is when the magic really starts to happen for the business, and it improves over time. Our goal is to become a true partner for your business by providing you with the right mix of accounting services for you and your business.

Our Story Eighty-One Eleven HR Consulting Services Our Story Passion. Integrity. Commitment. It s not just a number it s a legacy. 8111, not because that is the number of reasons why HR is important to your business, but because that s where it all began. Jenna is a 3rd generation entrepreneur following in the footsteps of both her father, Chris, and grandfather, Gene. 8111 Raytown Road is where Gene planted roots for his family and his business. He believed in building strong partnerships, providing the highest quality of work and investing in the betterment of others. He passed his legacy to Chris who worked hard to honor his father during the nearly 65 years of business that the company was open. In remembrance of her grandfather and the valuable lessons that she learned while visiting 8111 Raytown Road, Jenna (Henderson) Eschenbrenner, Owner/Founder of Eighty-One Eleven HR Consulting, strives to achieve the same core values that her grandfather once taught her.

Employment Based EB-3 Visas What is the EB-3 Visa Program? The EB-3 Visa Program, a third preference employment visa, grants permanent residency to skilled workers, unskilled workers, and professionals. It has less strict requirements than EB-1 and EB-2 visas but often longer wait times. Annually, 28.6% of employment green cards are allocated to EB-3, accounting for about 40,000 visas. Additionally, no more than 7% of EB-3 visas can go to applicants from any single country, leading to longer wait times for nationals from high-application countries like India and China. Despite potential delays, the EB-3 Visa Program is a valuable pathway to achieving permanent residency in the U.S. through employment.

  "email 1": "Hi Michelle,\n\nI stumbled on HR Synergy the other day and wanted to get in touch.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think HR Synergy could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Demonstrating effective employee onboarding processes\n• Explaining labor law compliance requirements\n• Walking through the benefits of outsourcing HR functions\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nI’d love to put together a quick concept; maybe a script or a short teaser; around one of your key offerings. No strings, just a preview of what's possible with HR Synergy's voice behind it.\n\nIf you’re curious about what this might look like, just reach out.

Bookkeepers track income and expenses, maintain organized records, and generate financial reports that help accountants prepare tax filings efficiently. Can a bookkeeper prepare financial statements? Yes, bookkeepers prepare financial statements such as profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. However, accountants typically review and analyze these reports. What are accounts payable & accounts recievable? Accounts Payable (AP): Money a business owes to suppliers or vendors. Accounts Receivable (AR): Money owed to a business by its customers. How can bookkeepers prevent financial errors? Bookkeepers can prevent errors by maintaining accurate records, performing regular reconciliations, implementing internal controls, and using accounting software with automation features. What industries need bookkeeping services? All businesses need bookkeeping, including retail, healthcare, construction, hospitality, non-profits, and professional services. Freelancers and independent contractors also benefit from bookkeeping services. Can bookkeepers work remotely? Yes, many bookkeepers offer remote services using cloud-based accounting software and secure file-sharing platforms. What should businesses look for in a bookkeeper? Businesses should look for bookkeepers with relevant experience, industry knowledge, proficiency in accounting software, attention to detail, and strong communication skills.

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor A People Partner, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Demonstrating how to streamline the hiring process with our recruitment tools\n• Showing how to optimize job postings for better candidate matches\n• Explaining the benefits of diversity and inclusion in the workplace\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nWould you be open to seeing a quick script or ten-second sketch built with A People Partner in mind? No expectations; just interested in showing you what’s possible.\n\nI’d be happy to chat if you’re interested. Just reply anytime, and feel free to check out some of our work through the link in my signature.\n\nThanks for putting something refreshing out there.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Howdy Alysa,\n\nFollowing up on my previous note about whiteboard animation at A People Partner.\n\nMany of our clients find these videos help explain their offerings faster and more clearly, which often leads to more meaningful conversations and better results.\n\nIf it’s helpful, I’d be happy to draft a quick concept or short sample that fits your brand voice and messaging.\n\nYou can reply anytime, and our portfolio is linked below if you want to get a feel for what we do.\n\nWarm regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 3": "Howdy Alysa,\n\nThought I would check in one last time.\n\nIf you are still curious what an animated whiteboard explainer might look like for A People Partner, I would be glad to share something rough, a short teaser, or a script to get the ball rolling.\n\nYou can find our work in the link below.

Project Services can be used, as needed, without a continued commitment. Our staff are experts at learning where you are and where you want to be, then defining a practical path to success. CONTACT US CONTACT US Change Management Do you see the need for change or are you hearing that needs to change frequently, and all you can see is a big blank monitor screen with a tiny blinking cursor that hasn t moved? Change is not always easy and one step that might help is to categorize your thoughts into the logical steps needed to accomplish change. Following Kotter s 8-step model we can help identify the process and steps needed for your best success. Coaching & Mentoring Executives, senior managers, teams, or individuals can always benefit from an outside perspective. Regardless of the need, a specific concern, or next steps in a career, we help individuals identify the gap between where they are now, where they want to be, and how to get there. Compensation Salary surveys, base pay programs, incentive systems, salary structures, policy and philosophy development, performance appraisal and merit pay systems, job evaluation, job ranking or grading programs, pay equity, and determination of exempt vs. non-exempt status are parts of compensation that need continued attention. We can provide expertise in design, refinement, and implementation of total compensation systems or segments. Compliance Digesting the mountain of federal, state, and local regulations is time-consuming and just about the time you think you have it figured out, something changes. The potential costs of response to claims, lawsuits, and loss of credibility with employees and customers make this a top priority in most organizations. Our team is up to date and can work with you to find the practical path to compliant management. Employee Surveys Do you actually know what your employees are thinking? Have you shared your thoughts with them? Employee surveys provide a road map for problem solving, facilitate communication in organizations, address employee relations concerns, and provide a baseline from which change can be made. We can help you develop questions and answers, reports, the roadmap to make change, and the communication necessary for achievements that balance organization capability with employee interests. Did an employee just leave your office or have they sent you an email outlining a complaint or a concern about a work situation that makes them uncomfortable and now you are wondering what to do? We can discuss the situation and help you determine the next steps. If an objective investigation is needed, we can complete a thorough workplace investigation, on any topic, including an assessment of the situation, questions for the parties involved, and documentation and presentation of the findings. Are you feeling a little, or a lot, out of your depth? Do you just need a quick sounding board to confirm you are headed in the right direction? We have the HR answers including compliance and practical application in every aspect of HR including strategic planning, recruitment, employee engagement, employee retention, learning and development, total rewards, the structure of your HR department, organizational effectiveness and development, workforce management, employee and labor relations, diversity and inclusion, health and safety, and the laws and rules that govern it all. How long has the creation or revising of that human resource policy, procedure, or guideline been sitting on your to-do list? Wouldn t it be nice to check it off the list? Contact one of our consultants for an estimate; we can create customized applications, handbooks, ADA, leave policies and forms, performance management, separation, and much more.

Our database of executive talent in packaging is second to none in the industry. We go beyond resumes. Candidates are identified and interviewed in a special step-by-step process designed to learn as much about their personalities as we do their experience and knowledge. By the time the candidates are presented to you, our client, we know far more about this candidate than can possibly be found on a resume. We check references every time. As former managers and officers of companies, we understand how the fast pace of business activity today leads to incomplete checking of references. We don t let that happen because neither you nor we can afford it. We maintain confidentiality. During this process of candidate identification and qualification, your company is not identified until a candidate expresses definite interest in the position. We prepare candidates for interviews. It is not our job to coach candidates but it is our job to assure that candidates are both serious and prepared when they arrive for an interview. Your time is valuable. We follow-through. After a series of interviews, we continue to probe candidates, answer their questions about responsibilities, relocation, and other issues. We assist in composing and extending the offer to the candidate and negotiating any changes. When needed, we can also provide relocation assistance and cost of living comparisons. We make it happen. The end result of this process is to make a match, to merge the talents of a top performer with your position. This is our commitment to you to make a successful match happen.

This meeting includes learning about your various systems and processes already in place and discussing options to help you better utilize what you re already investing in.

Don t let the big payroll companies or PEOs tell you otherwise. Your business has unique needs and personalities and a \"one-size\" approach to managing your HR does not work for your company that is far from one size. bottom of page Investigations | go-hr top of page WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS Sexual harassment and discrimination investigations are a reality in the workplace. Between 2018 and 2021, the EEOC received over 98,000 charges alleging harassment and over 27,000 charges alleging sexual harassment. Women reported 78.2% of sexual harassment cases and 62.2% of all harassment charges. Often, charges of harassment and other discrimination are filed in the same charge. In a 3-year period, the EEOC recovered nearly $300 million for individuals. Why Should You Use An Outside Resource To Conduct Your Workplace investigations? Outside investigators allow the employer to remain neutral and fair, reducing potential conflicts of interest and negative public perception. Employees who are asked to provide statements during an investigation tend to be more comfortable and more willing to be truthful and accurate with outside investigators than they would with an internal investigator who is known to them. Undue stress and potential bias are eliminated, especially if the investigation is of senior/executive leadership. It will allow in-house counsel to serve as a material witness if they did not conduct the investigation but did witness the incident. It allows the company and outside counsel to maintain attorney-client privilege if outside counsel focuses on providing legal advice and does not conduct the investigation. An outside investigator can alleviate the potential risk of a retaliation lawsuit and the company may call them as a witness during litigation. Outside investigators have been trained and have frequently conducted these types of investigations, whereas internal investigators may conduct investigations less frequently and therefore have less experience. Sharon DeLay, SPHR, SHRM-SCP is a Certified EEO Investigator and holds SHRM s Workplace Investigations Specialty Credential. In addition to training and development in investigations, she has completed hundreds of hours of investigations related to claims of discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace discord, and unfair workplace treatment.

ABOUT US Our Story ABOUT US Our Story After serving 20 years in the United States Air Force, John LeBrun, Jr. transitioned into a contracting role where, for 15 years, he refined his ability to understand and mitigate risks associated with managing large scale projects for the Federal Government. Cindy LeBrun excelled as a leader in several Dayton/Columbus area credit unions and retired after 35 years to take her experience to a new level and help others. With the ever-changing workplace environment, she offers customized climate assessments to help organizations build/repair existing cultures from the leadership team to the front line. Areas LMS excels are risk mitigation, project management, compliance, cyber security, table-top exercises, team building, customer/employee training programs, and leadership training/development. What started as a Veteran Owned small business, operating out of a back office of their home, quickly developed into a team with a reputation of trust and integrity. Now designated as a Woman Owned business and operating out of Beavercreek, LMS is growing and making a difference in the state of Ohio with their key differentiator being customized programs.

What People Are Saying client Testimonials What People Are Saying Client Testimonials We have partnered with LMSolutions since 2019 for Information Security remediation planning and tracking, as well as cybersecurity awareness training. With not having an IT person on staff, LMSolutions makes it easier for us to understand and remediate audit findings. Their cybersecurity training is great too! Bradley Mader, President, KH Credit Union We highly recommend LeBrun Management Solutions as a cybersecurity consultant. LMS has greatly improved our staff cybersecurity awareness and training processes, and in addition, they have provided us with excellent member cybersecurity educational content as well. On top of that, they also work closely with our IT staff in order to regularly assess our regulatory compliance in terms of IT security. Greg Kidwell, President, Pathways Financial Credit Union Our primary customer being the Department of Defense, DLA issued a requirement for certifiable cyber security . We selected LMS and we are glad we did. The team catered to exactly what we needed to be in compliance with NIST 800-171 and CMMC. We saw immediate results in an area with which we had very little experience. Their approach to training was organized, interactive and quite frankly entertaining. LMS provided a new level of certification and understanding for our business. We would highly recommend their services, as with LMS, you are treated with the utmost of courtesy, promptness, and professionality. Chri",

We were on and off again in 2016, then again in 2024. Since January 1, 2020, we have been working with the then-new white collar or EAP regulations. Ms. Walters has presented to overflow audiences on this topic. In 2016 and 2017, Ms. Walters testified before U.S. Congressional Committees regarding these regulatory changes. But employers need to consider more than just the federal rules. As of this writing, there are at least 19 states that have their own white-collar regulations, which in most cases are stricter than the federal rules and require their own analysis for proper exempt classification.

  "email 1": "Hey Tawana,\n\nI came across Organization At Its Best recently and thought I’d drop you a quick note.\n\nI'm Trent. I run Toon Theory, a whiteboard animation studio in the UK. We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think Organization At Its Best could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Walking through strategies for effective leadership in diverse teams\n• Explaining the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace\n• Demonstrating how to create an inclusive hiring process\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nI could pull together a quick sketch or sample script based on one of Organization At Its Best’s core offerings. Just a lightweight preview, no expectations; just to show what’s possible.\n\nYou’ll find a link to our site in my signature if you’d like to see a few examples. And if anything clicks, I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks for putting something refreshing out there.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Hi there Tawana,\n\nHope this finds you well. I’m following up on my previous email offering a quick, no-commitment demo to show how whiteboard animation might work for Organization At Its Best.\n\nThese animations are a great way to explain services or products in an engaging, easy-to-understand format.\n\nIf you’d like me to put something together, just let me know. You’ll find some past examples linked below too.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 3": "Howdy Tawana,\n\nJust circling back in case the timing makes more sense now. I still believe whiteboard animation could support something Organization At Its Best is working on, whether that is a pitch, process, or product.\n\nIf you would like to test the waters, I am happy to sketch something out to show what it might look like.\n\nYou will find past examples linked in my signature.

  "email 1": "Hi Kerron,\n\nI stumbled across Moore Solutions Consulting and thought I’d reach out.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Moore Solutions Consulting, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Explaining how to resolve organizational problems\n• Walking through the resume preparation process\n• Demonstrating how to create a development improvement plan\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to share a quick demo built around something Moore Solutions Consulting offers. Just a sketch or script; no pressure, no pitch; just curious to see what it might sound like in your voice.\n\nIf you’re curious about what this might look like, just reach out.

  "email 1": "Hi Connie,\n\nI came across iMap Strategic Solutions recently and thought there could be an opportunity to collaborate.\n\nI'm Trent. I run Toon Theory, a whiteboard animation studio in the UK. We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor iMap Strategic Solutions, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Demonstrating how to find the best company/culture fit for candidates\n• Explaining the proprietary analysis of motivational DNA for students\n• Walking through the benefits of Empowered Women's Leadership Retreats\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nCould I sketch something out for you? A short demo or script idea based on what iMap Strategic Solutions offers. No pitch; just something for you to react to.\n\nIf you're open to chatting more, just hit reply. And if you're curious, there’s a site link in my signature with a few past examples.\n\nThanks for putting something refreshing out there.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Howdy Connie,\n\nI didn’t want to leave things hanging without checking in. I mentioned how whiteboard animation can be a strong complement to what iMap Strategic Solutions is already doing, especially when you’re communicating ideas that needs a touch of individuality.\n\nIf it’s helpful, I can pull together a short visual sketch or sample script based on one of your key offerings.\n\nNo pressure; just a creative starting point for you to consider.\n\nYou’ll find some of our work linked in my signature.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 3": "Hello there Connie,\n\nJust reaching out again before I close this thread. If you think animated storytelling could be of value to iMap Strategic Solutions, I would love to put something together.\n\nEven a 10-second sketch can be a useful way to explore what is possible.\n\nFeel free to reply at your convenience.\n\nSincerely,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

No commitments at all, just a chance to show you what's possible.\n\nYou’ll find a link to our site in my signature if you’d like to see a few examples.

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor HR Anew, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Demonstrating how to navigate the company's document storage system\n• Walking through the process of creating a customized diversity solution for a business\n• Explaining the importance of EEO compliance in the workplace\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nI could pull together a quick sketch or sample script based on one of HR Anew’s core offerings. Just a lightweight preview, no expectations; just to show what’s possible.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring.

We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Explaining how to navigate complex payroll regulations\n• Walking through the process of setting up a 401(k) plan for employees\n• Demonstrating the benefits of outsourcing HR services\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nIf you're open to a quick preview, I could whip up a ten-second mock or short script tailored to something core at Infiniti HR; No pressure, no cost, purely exploratory.\n\nIf it feels like a fit, you can reply any time. There’s also a link in my signature in case you want to browse a few previous projects.\n\nThanks for leading with both heart and strategy.\n\nBest wishes,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

  "email 1": "Hello Jillian,\n\nI just saw IdeaLearning Group and thought you might be the right person to speak with.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think IdeaLearning Group could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Walking through the design and review process for training development\n• Explaining the benefits of a learner-centered approach\n• Demonstrating how to navigate custom eLearning modules\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nI’d be glad to pull together a short demo; maybe a script or quick sketch; based on what IdeaLearning Group does best. No pressure, just a chance to preview what it might look and sound like.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to take this further. You can check out some of our work through the link in my signature as well.\n\nKeep doing what you do, it's making an impact.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Hi there Jillian,\n\nWanted to follow up in case this timing works better for you. Whiteboard animation can be a surprisingly simple way to make your message clearer and more memorable; especially in B2B settings.\n\nFor IdeaLearning Group, this could mean increased understanding and stronger engagement, both internally and externally.\n\nIf you're still open to that quick sketch or demo, I’d be happy to create one based on something you’re working on.\n\nThere’s a link to our past projects in my signature if you’d like to browse.\n\nSincerely,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 3": "Hello Jillian,\n\nI wanted to check in one last time to offer support if you’re thinking about how IdeaLearning Group could benefit from whiteboard animation.\n\nWe’ve helped many businesses explain their offerings clearly and creatively through short, engaging videos.\n\nIf you’d like, I can draft a quick sample to show how this might work for you.\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to reply. Our past projects are linked below.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nPeople Group has a strong foundation, and a short animated video could be a powerful way to bring your message to life. We’ll take care of the full creative lift: script, voice, and illustrations, so you can use it for:\n\n• Explaining employee benefits and how to enroll\n• Showing how to clock in and out accurately\n• Demonstrating how to navigate payroll processing online\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nCould I sketch something out for you? A short demo or script idea based on what People Group offers. No pitch; just something for you to react to.\n\nReply anytime if you'd like to talk more about this.

The software has many features that makes keeping track of employees' information quick and painless. This software is capable of handling much more. Absolute Technology offers other services with additional costs, such as direct deposit, pay garnishments, accessories for the electronic time clock. Payroll Problems If your company is like most, your payroll system is less than perfect(!) The average employer with hourly workers spends more time on payroll issues than any other single element of administration! Inaccurate time cards must be corrected Supervisors spend hours on schedule and attendance verification Data must be transferred to the payroll system Inaccurate paychecks generate unhappy employees Resolving employee disputes costs time, money and morale Now there is a system that eliminates the paperwork, that can be verified by supervisors in less than 10 minutes a day and works seamlessly all the way from the time clock to the completion of paychecks. If this sounds like a system you need right now, call us for more information at (541) 312-9041 , or go to our contact us page. Payroll Problems How it works Absolute Technology Payroll integrates the entire process, from the time clock to the paycheck. Our system that begins with an electronic time clock that is directly linked to the system software. Employees use a credit card-sized magnetic card to check in and out, similar to processing a credit card. The system compares the entry time to the employee s schedule for initial verification, and the information becomes available to multiple supervisor workstations. A security and password system allows grouping of employees by supervisor and administrator so that all levels are protected from unauthorized examination or modification. On a daily (or other) basis, a group supervisor can audit and modify clock punches and compare them to each employee s planned schedule. Confirming/editing a 15-30 person group takes less than ten minutes. On a weekly (or other) basis, a supervisor prints a group report that each employee can review for accuracy. When all employees are confirmed, the report can be batch transferred to payroll. The system prevents partial transfers, duplicate transfers, and transfer of information that is in dispute. On the pre-determined pay schedule, checks are cut, taxes withheld and management reports generated for delivery to the pay site. If this sounds like a system you need right now, call us for more information at (541) 312-9041 , or go to our contact us page. Payroll Problems Frequent Questions I have a manual system for 15 employees. Can the Absolute Technology Payroll system save me money? Usually it can, but 'apples to apples' comparisons are difficult. Many of the costs of manual systems are hidden, and it may look like your manual system is cheaper than it actually is. Such things as supervisor corrections, discussions of vacation time earned, and penalties for improper tax withholdings are a few of the items that can be overlooked. The best thing about the Absolute Technology system is that every element is integrated, so that the process is more likely to be smooth, and mistakes are easy to correct. A system that works saves more money every year that you have it. I already have an automated system. Why should I switch? If you are happy with your system, you shouldn't. However, some of the reasons we hear from our current customers are that they like the ease of reviewing time-clock information, that was something they weren't getting from their old system. Others tell us that they like the fact that we can deliver completed payroll checks and tax withholding reports, freeing their human resources department to do things that only they can do. In the end, it is simply a question of whether we can help you overcome problems that you might currently have. Do I need a new electronic time clock? In all likelihood, you do. It's the foundation for everything that follows, (you've heard of 'garbage in, garbage out'?) What if I need technical support? If you need it, you get it. We're selling headache relief, and support all our installed systems. Do you have a question that didn't get answered? Call us at (541) 312-9041 , or go to our contact us page. Payroll Problems System Demo Youtube Video A useful demo can be tailored to your specific situation. Give us a call at (541) 312-9041 to discuss your company and the way you currently track details like hours worked, vacation schedules, sick days, and authorized absences. Payroll Problems About Us Absolute Technology, Inc. grew from an exercise in addressing the challenges of a real company. When we realized that not even the largest payroll companies could solve our problems, we knew we would have to write our own software. With our background in computer programming, and a very real company payroll to streamline, we built an integrated system from the ground up. At each stage of development, we could see the results, talk to the supervisors about additional requirements, and in general, to optimize the entire system. When the project was complete, we thought we were done. However, the company president had other plans. \"As good as this thing works for us,\" he said, \"I think other companies would like it, too. Let's make a commercial version that's flexible enough to be tailored to other businesses.\" That's it, in a nutshell. Unlike companies that have technology, but don't really understand business, or some of the big payroll companies that are so invested in the old ways of doing things that they can't change their approach, we started with only one idea -- to solve the payroll problem. We might be able to solve yours, too. Give us a call at (541) 312-9041.

The time can also be remotely set to guarantee that the clock is in sync with the administrative system. Is this the kind of integrated system you need? Call us at",

How to get a derailed executive career back on track! - Devon James Associates, Inc. since 1992 Home The Book Purchase the Book Contact Us What Clients Say Executive Job Search Program \" from Bedlam to Boardroom ...How to get a derailed executive career back on track!\" by Colleen Aylward From Bedlam to Boardroom lets the reader in on the new ground rules for creating essential visibility, and offers a detailed road-map with helpful examples, timelines and insider tips for becoming a niche authority and getting in front of hiring managers. It is a rich resource that greatly increases the odds that an executive will be pursued as the targeted executive job candidate in today's market. And it is a how-to manual for adopting the essential new career-management practices necessary to maintain competitive advantage. FROM THE AUTHOR: After thousands of interviews in the 20 years of my retained recruiting practice, it is clear that Executive Job Seekers still rely on expert advice from the inside when faced with a recent or impending exit from a downsizing employer. And buying a book that empathizes with their situation, or points them to some immediate action plan is often their first step, especially when they can t afford the seminar that may tell them the same things. The 10 chapters in from Bedlam to Boardroom are filled with the competitive edge that I offer to these high level clients on a one-on-one basis. But it is evident that more and more executives are seeking this advice, after they have tried the traditional ways of job search and found them useless. Angst-filled executives come to me in desperation at the eleventh hour, with doubts about their current value, because they have never before had to look for a job. They wonder: \"What has happened?\" \"Am I no longer employable?\" \"Is this just a blip that will self-correct?\" \"When the economy comes roaring back, will the job search rules go back to what they once were?\" \"Will high-level generalists ever be back in demand?\" \"Am I still relevant? Viable?\" \"Will my next job come from my inner circle of business friends as usual, or is there some new game?\" After working together for a few hours, using the same practices that are now here in the book, my clients tell me, I wish I would have known this 6 months ago. And that critical knowledge boils down to this: The world is an online community now, and the future of your employment status is highly dependent on your ability to adapt. Moving forward in your career is all about digitizing your brand now: Positioning yourself on the global internet as an expert in something; Becoming an authority online; Solving particular problems in a particular niche and letting the world know that you did it and can do it again; Creating a virtual network of business connections as your audience and as your support infrastructure; And making sure that you are found. From Bedlam to Boardroom lets the reader in on the new ground rules for creating essential visibility, and offers a detailed roadmap with helpful examples, timelines and insider tips for becoming a niche authority and getting in front of hiring managers. It is a rich resource that greatly increases the odds that an executive will be pursued as the targeted executive job candidate in today's market. And it is a how-to manual for adopting the essential new career-management practices necessary to maintain competitive advantage.

She knows how to use the web for visibility, create a strategy for networking with the right people and on through to how to package your unique expertise and communicate effectively with recruiters and hiring managers along the way. Colleen has over 20 years in the executive recruiting business and has now become a leading Job Search Coach -- she knows how employers and recruiters work from inside the hiring machine. As a B2B Sales expert, I've always been a forward-thinker when it comes to using technology to create value. Thanks to Colleen's approach to online executive branding, I now understand how web software is increasing my personal value. I recommend Colleen without reservation. She is a first class professional who is super talented, works hard and delivers results.\" Trigg Villani, Business Development Executive \"As a senior sales executive in the technology sector, currently as a Sales Director for Oracle, I ve dealt with many executive coaches and executive recruiters over the years. None have morphed so effectively as Colleen Aylward from the world of retained recruiting to that of Executive Career Search Coach. This is why I ve referred her to close business associates on multiple occasions. Her expertise from 20+ years at the helm of Devon James Associates, plus her years spend on OUR side of the table (as a technology sales executive herself) make her the perfect coach for those who need to understand the landscape of today s executive recruiting world works, as well as, the extreme importance of executive online branding of yourself in today s information rich world. As driven executives in technology, none of us has had the time or inclination to work on social media or online branding or SEO of that brand. Colleen couples her easy going attitude with the inside knowledge how people search for executives, what they want to see, where they want to see it, and how to rank highly for those eyeballs. I have come to realize how important an executive brand is, and how critical it is to have ubiquitous social proof of one s niche expertise. Her book from Bedlam to Boardroom is an easy read and gives you the road map steps of marketing one s self your own brand and of ensuring that the right people find you when they need your expertise. Her passion about executive branding, her technical expertise in this area, and the fact that she can understand and pinpoint the unique skill sets of just about any executive these days, is a rare and wonderful combo in today s world of a million coaches \" Minkyung Lowe, Strategic Ecommerce Operations, Supply Chain Development \"As an Amazonian manager, I came to Colleen only because I thought I needed a few tips on researching possible next steps in the Seattle area. Because I had always been heads down in my career not out in the job market -- I was blown away about several things she showed me: No matter how great you are on paper, it s now all about social proof. Secondly, you cannot push yourself out to employers and recruiters these days UNLESS you have your solid brand out there on the web AND have social proof of your worth. And thirdly, it s not even about pushing yourself out to recruiters. It s about building your expertise brand as a magnet, so that employers and recruiters actually come to you are drawn to you in their searches -- instead of the other way around. In a few short months, with Colleen s coaching, I built a solid brand presence all over the web, and received two awesome high-level job ",

  "email 1": "Hello Horace,\n\nI just saw Francis & Company and thought you might be the right person to speak with.\n\nI'm Trent. I run Toon Theory, a whiteboard animation studio in the UK. We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFrancis & Company has a strong foundation, and a short animated video could be a powerful way to bring your message to life. We’ll take care of the full creative lift: script, voice, and illustrations, so you can use it for:\n\n• Walking through the auditing process for new clients\n• Explaining tax planning strategies for entrepreneurs\n• Setting up QuickBooks for small business owners\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to share a quick demo built around something Francis & Company offers. Just a sketch or script; no pressure, no pitch; just curious to see what it might sound like in your voice.\n\nIf you’re curious about what this might look like, just reach out.

We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Formations, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Demonstrating how to set up an S-Corp and register for an EIN\n• Walking through the process of calculating tax savings with S-Corp management\n• Explaining the benefits of automating back office tasks for small businesses\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nI'd be more than happy to whip up a quick snippet; a short script or sketch; that speaks to what Formations does best. No commitments at all, just a chance to show you what's possible.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring.

  "web copy": "Wilson Jones Commissioning Prev Next WHAT WE DO Wilson Jones Commissioning WHAT WE DO Wilson Jones Commissioning has provided commissioning and retro commissioning services to building owners and general contractors for 19 years in the Puget Sound region. Our firm is a commissioning firm with 100 percent of our work dedicated to building commissioning. We specialize in the technically complex building market such as hospitals, laboratories and research facilities. Our Goal Our goal is to maximize the capabilities of the building we commission and its infrastructure systems to provide the best environment for the people working in those spaces. In order to achieve this, we ensure that those infrastructure systems are set up and tuned to be as energy efficient as possible and then we help the Owner in the transition from the Construction Team operating the facility to the Owner operating the facility. SERVICES Wilson Jones Commissioning Commissioning Services Wilson Jones Commissioning provides full-service commissioning services including design review, commissioning plan development, OPR, development of Basis of Design documentation and systems manuals, writing/review of commissioning specifications, development of controls startup plans and oversight, development of equipment startup plans and oversight, development and execution of Functional Performance Tests (FPTs), Test and Balancing (TAB) verification and oversight, commissioning schedule coordination with General Contractor, Owner training oversight, O&M documentation review, and post occupancy review and follow up. We can provide either Commissioning Agent services, hired by the Owner as a direct representative, or Test Engineering services, directing and performing testing under the scope of the General Contractor. Benefits As Mechanical, Electrical, and Life Safety systems become more complex, some Owners have found themselves with systems that do not function to meet their needs; problems with control systems, maintenance access, long shake-down periods, inadequate documentation, and high operating costs are just a few of the problems encountered. Commissioning helps ensure that these building systems are functional and maintainable. The Design team also benefits by helping define, within the contract documents, Contractor participation and deliverables required for successful start-up/testing, and by early identification of problems through design review. The Contractor team benefits through a systematic approach to quality assurance with the goal of obtaining final Certificate of Occupancy within the construction schedule. Code Requirements Many utilities and building organizations have provided incentives for commissioning as reports of monetary savings, energy savings, and Owner satisfaction due to commissioning have been published. In addition, some code jurisdictions are beginning to require commissioning of energy-related systems and equipment. The 2009 Washington State Energy Code requires commissioning of HVAC, lighting control, and domestic hot water systems, and issuance of the building Temporary Certificate of Occupancy is contingent upon the submittal of the preliminary draft Final Commissioning Report. Utility incentives, such as Puget Sound Energy s New Construction Commissioning Grant , offer reward for additional energy-related commissioning activities, such as building envelope testing and energy sub-metering verification. Our commissioning activities also count toward the U.S. Green Building Council LEED rating system, providing recognition of sustainable construction aspects of a construction project. All projects attempting LEED certification must fulfill the requirements of LEED BD+C v4. Budgeting Budgeting for either Commissioning Agent or Test Engineer services varies based on the complexity and size of the project, and the scope of commissioning services desired. Industry-published costs for commissioning range between 2% to 5% of Mechanical construction cost and 1% to 3% of Electrical construction cost. Historically, our fees range between 1% to 3% of Mechanical cost and 0.5% to 1.5% of Electrical cost. LEADERSHIP Wilson Jones Commissioning Leadership EDWARD JONES, PE, LEED AP, CCP Partner, Commissioning Specialist Edward Jones brings over twenty five years of professional experience to his role as Commissioning Specialist at Wilson Jones Commissioning.

Contact: cwilson@wjcengineers.com CERTIFICATIONS & AFFILIATIONS Wilson Jones Commissioning Certifications and Affiliations Wilson Jones Commissioning, LLC is certified Washington State's Minority Business Enterprise (MBE), Federal Government's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) and Small Business Enterprise (SBE) and King County's Contracting Opportunities Program for Small Contractors and Suppliers (SCS). We are also active in the U. S. Federal Government's System for Award Management (SAM). Wilson Jones Commissioning is an active member in the Building Commissioning Association (BCA), US Green Building Council (USGBC) and is an authorized Energy Star Service Provider. OUR APPROACH Wilson Jones Commissioning Our Approach To help prolong the life of building systems and to create the best environment for the occupant, we provide quality assurance to uncover deficiencies in design, construction, installation, programming and operation with our thorough approach. Thorough Design reviews We conduct very rigorous review of design documentation, including the full MEP set and architectural components that may have an effect on the MEP design. Owners, Ed Jones and Cindy Wilson, both have MEP design backgrounds which gives us great insight into the \"why's\" and \"how's\" of MEP design concepts. We put a lot of emphasis on the design review process because it is least costly to fix something during the design process and more costly to fix something the further along it gets in construction. Startup We witness all startup of equipment that includes integral controls to ensure the equipment is set up properly to work within the bigger system that is being installed. Functional Performance Testing We do comprehensive equipment testing with batch testing, testing every piece of equipment, but concentrating on the aspects that have the most direct impact on the people who use the space. This is more cost effective and we have discovered that this increases occupant and owner satisfaction. Training We take a very active part in the training process. We put together a training plan, including a calendar, training session agendas, and work with the contractors and vendors to get appropriate instructors. technical expertise and troubleshooting One of our strengths as a company is our ability to help troubleshoot. With our backgrounds in design, TAB, controls and our experience in this business, we've developed a thorough understanding of the equipment and controls so we can successfully solve issues and offer solid advice.

They worked effectively with each stakeholder - Owner, Occupant, Contractor, Architect/Engineer - facilitating a practical understanding of the equipment and control systems. Their communication and reporting was clear and concise. When issues or problems arose, they acted quickly to define the problem, research solutions and then verify solution implementation.

  "email 1": "Hi Cynthia,\n\nI stumbled on Wilson Jones Commissioning the other day and wanted to get in touch.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Wilson Jones Commissioning, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how to navigate complex commissioning plans\n• Demonstrating the benefits of Functional Performance Tests (FPTs)\n• Explaining the importance of Basis of Design documentation\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nCould I sketch something out for you? A short demo or script idea based on what Wilson Jones Commissioning offers. No pitch; just something for you to react to.\n\nIf you're open to chatting more, just hit reply. And if you're curious, there’s a site link in my signature with a few past examples.\n\nKeep doing what you do, it's making an impact.\n\nRespectfully,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Hi Cynthia,\n\nReaching out again in case the idea of using whiteboard animation is still on your radar.\n\nIt’s often a great fit for simplifying dense content, making internal updates more engaging, or curating educational content that feel less overwhelming and more human.\n\nFor Wilson Jones Commissioning, I’d be glad to sketch a quick visual or draft a short script so you can see what this might look like in practice.\n\nReply when you can, or check out some examples in the signature below.\n\nWarm regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 3": "Hi Cynthia,\n\nCircling back once more before I close the loop.\n\nIf there is anything at Wilson Jones Commissioning you have been meaning to simplify, such as those boring quarterly reports your team never reads, then whiteboard animation could help bring that to life.\n\nI would be happy to sketch something if you want to see what that might look like. You can reply anytime or check out some of our previous work on our website, linked in my signature.\n\nBest wishes,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

  "email 1": "Hello Terry,\n\nI just saw DevSelect and thought you might be the right person to speak with.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think DevSelect could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Explaining the benefits of DevOps for software development\n• Demonstrating cybersecurity best practices for remote teams\n• Walking through cloud migration strategies for small businesses\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nHow about a quick sample built around DevSelect's strengths? Ten seconds or so, no strings, no commitments. Just a feeler to see what resonates.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring. In the meantime, you can view a few past projects via the link in my signature.\n\nThanks for leading with both heart and strategy.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Howdy Terry,\n\nWanted to follow up in case this timing works better for you. Whiteboard animation can be a surprisingly simple way to make your message clearer and more memorable; especially in B2B settings.\n\nFor DevSelect, this could mean increased understanding and stronger engagement, both internally and externally.\n\nIf you're still open to that quick sketch or demo, I’d be happy to create one based on something you’re working on.\n\nThere’s a link to our past projects in my signature if you’d like to browse.\n\nSincerely,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 3": "Hey there Terry,\n\nA quick follow-up before I close out my list. If now is not the right time, no worries at all.\n\nBut if you are a little curious about how whiteboard animation might help DevSelect, I am still open to sharing a quick demo. No pressure. You can reply anytime or skim through some of our previous projects to see what we have done for other businesses.

We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas.

Totally low-lift, just keen to explore what this could look like with Collective Seven's voice behind it.\n\nJust reach out if you’d like to continue the conversation.

Stephen Paul Director Analytics and Innovation / True Blue Inc. \"In my 30+ years in the technology industry, I ve had the opportunity to work with hundreds of highly skilled folks of all disciplines but it is very few of them that rival the technical and design skills of Seabeck Systems. Seabeck has excellent communication skills and very disciplined development habits and methods to go along with it.\" Al Teel Senior Manager - Systems Development / Iron Mountain Inc. I have known Peter Loos since 1995. I highly value his overall ability to deliver solutions to the extent that when we no longer worked for the same organization, I retained his company Seabeck Systems as an outside consultant to build the Distributor Sales Reporting database for Dux Dental / Vettec Inc. They are thorough and detailed in their approach, but can still see the big picture objective. Seabeck Systems seems internally motivated to drive and succeed in every endeavor they undertake. Dale Akita Chief Financial Officer / DUX Industries Inc. Unfortunately, this is all too common, says Peter Loos. We almost always find the same root causes. Recently a client was referred to Seabeck Systems for an IoT strategy assessment. They had spent years hiring different vendors to launch their IoT program with limited success. Unfortunately, this is all too common, says Peter Loos. We almost always find the same root causes failure to form a business-driven strategy, a stubborn refusal to document business requirements, under-skilled and over-worked staff, and a shoestring budget. Seabeck Systems assessed and summarized the learnings of their IoT efforts. We identified underlying challenges, and outlined a roadmap to help their team avoid future pitfalls. We focus on prioritizing the issues, getting the right people from the business involved from the start, forming realistic estimates, and identifying what steps the team can take for themselves to save costs.

  "email 1": "Hi Peter,\n\nI came across Seabeck Systems recently and wanted to reach out directly.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think Seabeck Systems could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Demonstrating the value of virtual IT leadership in achieving business goals\n• Walking through the benefits of hourly consulting for businesses\n• Explaining how roadmap generation can streamline IT operations\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nI’d be glad to pull together a short demo; maybe a script or quick sketch; based on what Seabeck Systems does best. No pressure, just a chance to preview what it might look and sound like.\n\nIf it feels like a fit, you can reply any time. There’s also a link in my signature in case you want to browse a few previous projects.\n\nThanks for putting something refreshing out there.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

While she s spent the majority of her career in public accounting, Stephanie has also worked on the inside of both small and large businesses. From handling the books of a small produce market to working in the accounting department of a large construction company, she understands the day-to-day demands clients face. Stephanie s focus over the past 10 years has been to develop an advisory practice in her firm. In 2009, Stephanie was one of 10 CPAs in the US and Canada accepted into a Master Advisor program. This intensive 2-year program provided advisors with a focused perspective on helping clients identify and solve problems to reach their goals as well as talk about current client needs and how CPAs could better address them. In 2011, Stephanie received her Master Advisor Certification, after completing the rigorous 2-year program of study with honors.

What makes us different? We ve gotten away from the hourly time clock that drives so many professionals. Instead, we want to focus on the goals & end result of working with our clients. We provide custom, fixed price agreements that set fees and the scope of our work ahead of time. We ve found that fixed price agreements eliminate unwanted surprises and a feeling of being nickel & dimed by the client as well as allow for value billing for work performed.

We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Demonstrating how the 10X360 12 MONTH IMPLEMENTATION SYSTEM can boost revenue\n• Walking through the benefits of a Finance Essentials Workshop for small business owners\n• Explaining the importance of effective leadership in the Operations Essentials Workshop\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nCould I sketch something out for you? A short demo or script idea based on what Cardone Ventures offers. No pitch; just something for you to react to.\n\nYou’ll find a link to our site in my signature if you’d like to see a few examples. And if anything clicks, I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks for leading with both heart and strategy.\n\nWith appreciation,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

Working with the entire team has made my payroll processing a breeze. Everyone is professional, knowledgeable, and reliable. The prompt support I have received monthly from Courtnie, is exceptional.

Our team of professionals at Divorce Strategies Northwest understands the complexity, fear, stress, and confusion that the process of divorce entails. You re thrust into a crash course you never hoped to take! Our team will help you consider your options and develop a strategy that encompasses your personal and family needs, now and in the future. We offer our clients personal, scalable services, for less than one-quarter of most attorney billing rates. With our experience, you will be empowered with knowledge, understand your case and the divorce process , and how to advocate for yourself. Frequently Asked Questions Why should I work with you? At DSNW we understand that divorce is about people and families. Divorce is about your emotions, your wants and needs, and in many ways will define your future for years to come. There is far more to a successful divorce than working with an attorney. Our team approaches to divorce in a holistic way we are compassionate partners to help educate you through the process of divorce. Individual: If you are considering or facing divorce and feel alone, scared, stuck, or unsure of how to proceed, we can provide you with strategic guidance + compassionate support. Couple: If you want to work cooperatively with a team of experts, we can help. You can find more information on our services options HERE . Are you an attorney? We are a team of divorce experts who specialize in mediation, life and divorce coaching, parent coaching, client advocacy and financial aspects of your dissolution case. Can I work with the DSNW team instead of hiring an attorney? For individuals in high-conflict situations, an attorney is essential to provide the legal support required for a contentious case. However, working with our team can minimize attorney hours by helping you work more efficiently and effectively with your legal team. Our work with couples in our Conscious Uncoupling package reduces attorney time and legal fees even more. When working with couples, our team handles the preparation, negotiation and drafting of all the legal documentation necessary for your divorce. We partner with local attorneys for expert review prior to legal filing of all case documentation. Are you therapists? Many of our clients come to DSNW via a recommendation from their therapist. Our service is a great option between personal therapy, marital counseling and hiring a divorce attorney. We do not provide therapy; we provide divorce coaching services to help clients understand what they want and need, during their divorce and beyond. We often refer clients to talented therapists (in a variety of modalities + specialties), to do the intense emotional work that is often required during a divorce. Who does DSNW work with? We work with both individuals and couples who are either considering divorce or ready to proceed with the divorce process. For couples, we offer our Conscious Uncoupling package which focuses on coaching + mediation services. For individuals, we offer our Breaking Free package which includes coaching, strategy development and legal document drafting services. Why should I hire DSNW and not an attorney? Most clients find it advantageous to speak with our team prior to hiring an attorney. We do not replace a divorce attorney; we minimize their time and augment their expertise with our focused support + preparation. Family Law attorneys are experts at Family Law. While attorneys are experts at interpreting and applying the law to your case, most are not well-equipped to provide emotional support and detailed guidance needed as families impart major changes. Because we bill at a lower hourly rate, our prep work helps clients come into the attorney process more organized and well-prepared, with much of the homework done in advance. Couples who choose to work within our guided mediation process minimize their attorney time to only a few hours for final legal review. Our goal is to keep our clients and their families away from Family Court. This means you and your spouse are making decisions for your family, not the state (court), and not dueling attorneys. Our team works with you to educate both parties and confidentially bring your case to private resolution. What if I m already working with an attorney? We can work with you on an hourly basis to provide you with coaching and strategy development. Our Strategy on Demand service works alongside your attorney to provide extra guidance and support as needed. See Our Services for more information about what is provided with Strategy on Demand. What exactly will you do for me? Our process of support is similar when working with individuals and with couples. We start with an extensive introductory meeting with each client individually, to clearly understand their priorities, goals, concerns and identify any potential obsta",

I really appreciate you helping me out. You re the best attorney ever! D. I appreciate your help, understanding and aggressive efforts on my behalf. E. T. I have hired Lennard numerous times over years to handle my cases, ranging from class B felonies to gross misdemeanors. I was looking at 6-9 years of incarceration and Lennard has gotten two of my biggest cases dismissed and others reduced to practically nothing. Every time I consulted with him, he is extremely knowledgeable, tactical, honest, caring, and straight forward. And we have been in 4 different Courthouses around State of Washington, and in every Courthouse, he is very well-known with the judges, prosecutors, and staffs, which re-insured me that I was in very good hands. I m confidently able to recommend him to my closest friends and family who are dealing with legal issues, because I know they are going to be represented by the best. Lennard has basically helped me to receive another chance in life to start over and has helped me to learn from my mistakes and move on to being a better person. There are no any other lawyers like him. J. K. The best attorney on earth! J. S. G. You all are very professional and effective operation and I appreciate everything you done for me. Your staff, they are simply the best. C. S. Your staff has treated me with great respect and kindness. You are very blessed to have such a wonderful group of people working for you. They have always been very helpful and pleasant to talk with. P. J. C. I live on the other side of the country and had a case come up in his location. Well I came across the best. Started everything off from the first day, kept in contact with me every few days, and then day to day as the case came closer. He handled it VERY professionally with outstanding knowledge of the law. He helped me with everything I needed to do in defense of myself. He helped me retain my civil liberties from false accusations. I wish I didn t need him, but so glad I had him. J. S. I really do appreciate your help. The courtesy that I received from your staff I will never forget. The professionalism in the court room was very comforting even though the process is lengthy and the charge was minor. My case was handled by the firm with the utmost care. Thank you! T. P. Lennard was recommended to me from a good friend. This was a first time offense in my 55 yrs. I was embarrassed and humiliated to have to go through this ever. Lennard s Professionalism, Experience, Sensitivity and Respect to a client s needs was exceptional. His staff was professional as well and relayed my messages to him when he was unavailable due to his busy schedule of helping another client. Lennard always got back to me via phone or email, depending on the questions I had. His presence in the court room definitely showed that he had respect from his peers and superiors. I would highly recommend The Nahajski Firm. E. A Thanks for bringing our son s case to a very successful conclusion. You and your staff were very professional and helpful. T. M. I would like to sincerely thank you for all of the effort you put towards my case. I was very impressed with the professional manner in which I was represented and the profuse knowledge held by the partners of your firm. I consider myself very lucky to have found you. While I hope to avoid requiring your services in the future, I did very much enjoy meeting and working with you. Thank you very much. M. A. M. I do not recall a moment in my life that made me as astoundingly happy as those few words uttered from the judge s mouth on my court appearance. I want to thank you and your partners for the work you did for me again. Hopefully, I will not be asking for them again, but if need be, I know now who to call. I say that not because of the results, but because of the tremendous amount of concern, humanity (the dog was a nice touch), integrity and professionalism displayed by all in your firm in your dealings with me. D. W. M. I spoke with Rayne Nelson, the information that I was given over the phone and all the answers to all of my questions that I had at the time was extremely remarkable. I felt that all of the attorneys had more knowledge and experience in criminal law than any of the other attorneys that I had spoken with. Your office was ready to give me a free person-to-person consultation needless to say: the search was over for an attorney. A big heart-felt THANK YOU VERY MUCH. R. R. Just want to let you know how much we appreciate you taking the time to help us out! Whenever we need your help it is a time of high stress for our family and you always take away a lot of the anxiety with your friendly, efficient manner and expert experience. Thank you! L.A. On behalf of me, Mike and Eli we d like to thank-you for doing such a fine job of representing Eli. It meant a great deal to us and you always kept us informed and we always felt we were in good hands. Thanks again! L.S. I am writing to express my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to you and to Rayne for your excellent work achieving such a positive outcome in my defense against the State of Washington. Success in this matter did not appear to me to be in the least bit a foregone conclusion, and I believe that without your legal expertise and personal dedication to my cause I would be in a far more unpleasant situation today. Rayne was indeed brilliant at the pre-trial and your strategy and research prior to that day was obviously flawless. I am extremely grateful for this second chance that your work has secured me. Please thank the members of your office staff on my behalf for their professionalism and competency during my frequent communications with them. Their efficiency and assurance was much appreciated. G.R.F. He won my case, and I now have no criminal history nor did I go to prison, so I m very glad with the outcome. I ll make sure I don t make any mistakes, however if I ever did need a criminal defense lawyer, I would hire Lennard all over again. R.Y. Mr. Nahajski handled my case quickly and efficiently. He is not only extremely competent attorney but he actually made the entire ordeal go smoothly and alleviated my stress and concern. I truly felt that he was proactive in his approach instead of just getting to my case when he had to as so many other attorneys do. C.J. Our case was very complicated. It not only had Criminal but also Immigration consequences. We are glad that we chose Len to handle our case. He is the best criminal lawyer one can find. He is very knowledgeable and I strongly recommend that you talk to Len if you are looking for a good lawyer to represent your case. J.S. When I think back to it, it occurs to me that I was very fortunate to have found you as an attorney. You are not only an excellent attorney, but you are also a good man. I m not sure how common that is in your field, but I suspect not all that common. G.S. Very competent and trustworthy. Knows his business. . . . This was a whole new experience for me. With Lennard s help, the case was dismissed. D.S. Mr. Nahajski was hired as my lawyer three times. A DUI case, suspended license case, and another DUI, assault, drug and harassment case. The possible ramifications for my actions included prison time and a felony that would follow me the rest of my life. Lennard got me the best possible outcome for all of my cases. No jail time. He is professional, non-judgmental, extremely educated, and highly respected among his peers and the criminal justice system. A.S. Len was such a pleasure to work with. He was patient and explained all of my options and answered all of my questions along the way. He came up with a great strategy for my case and was there every step of the way until we had the best resolution possible. Case dismissed! I hope I never need a lawyer again but if I do, I know who to call. L.N. I am so happy that Len represented me. He worked tirelessly, kept me in the loop at all times, and was amazing in court. He had both short-term and long-term strategies and got my case dismissed by using his thorough understanding of the law. He was professional and personable, and I d recommend him to anyone. K.S. If you need a lawyer call Len Nahajski. Case dismissed. F.G. WE ARE HERE TO PROVIDE LEGAL HELP The Nahajski Firm was established in 1996 by partners Lennard A. Nahajski and Rayne J.

With Bachelor s degrees in Political Science, Sociology, and Interdisciplinary Studies from Central Washington University and a law degree from Seattle University, Nicole's academic foundation is both broad and deep, equipping her with a unique perspective on the complexities of Elder Law. Before founding Salish Elder Law, Nicole honed her skills and knowledge in an Edmonds Elder Law firm. Prior to discovering the field of elder law, she worked at a Seattle firm focused on personal injury and criminal defense, experiences that now enrich her elder law practice, specifically related to elder abuse. Her transition to Elder Law was driven by a commitment to serve the elder community, a field she is deeply passionate about. Nicole thrives on the challenges and complexities inherent in this area of law, and she is dedicated to providing her clients with the highest level of service and advocacy. Nicole's commitment to the legal profession extends beyond her practice.

Her undergraduate degree is in Political Science from the University of Maine, Portland. After graduating from law school she clerked for the Hon. Robert Klein of Honolulu. She worked for a brief time at a personal injury litigation law firm in Honolulu. (She didn t like it.) Then Peggy moved to Washington, DC, and went to work as a legislative analyst for the Hon. George Mitchell when he was Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate. She dealt with critical issues affecting the State of Maine, especially fisheries. After Senator Mitchell retired, Peggy fell in love with Washington. She started over here with a career in local legislation, working primarily as a legal analyst for King County and for Snohomish County. Two major events in her life caused Peggy to change course and dedicate herself to Elder Law. The first was when her mother in Maine succumbed to dementia after suffering the disease for 5 years. The second was when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer, and spent a year undergoing difficult treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. From these experiences, Peggy developed a deep empathy and understanding of the profound physical, emotional and financial effects chronic and debilitating disease can have on her clients. Her conviction grew that people in their later years need and deserve topnotch legal services to protect their assets, provide for their increasing needs, preserve their independence, protect them from exploitation and provide for assistance when independent living is no longer safe or appropriate. Peggy is the past President of the Washington Academy of Elder Law Attorneys and is their 2017 Attorney of the Year. She is also a long-time member of the Edmonds Chamber of Commerce. Peggy L.

Marcia and John K Los Angeles, CA Tax Problems that We Solve IRS Back Tax Returns If you are facing back tax issues , the most important thing you can do is to become compliant again with the IRS. Usually this means going back and filing all of the back tax returns that you didn t do in years past, but there are a few things that can make this much faster and easier. We can save you a TON when it comes to claiming deductions and making sure everything lines up correctly, so give us a call today to see how we can help you. More About IRS Back Tax Returns Bank Levy One step further than a tax lien is for the bank to actually place a levy on your property , and physically take it to pay back what you owe. This is legal thievery on the part of the government, and can be placed on your home, cars, boats, property, etc.! If you have had a notice of an impending levy on your property, then you need to act quickly to have that removed before the government will come and take possession of your hard-earned property! More About Bank Levy Tax Lien One of the more impactful steps that the federal government can take against you is to put a tax lien on your property. This basically means that they take legal ownership of the property until all debts can be paid off on it. You won t be able to sell, refinance, or don t actually legally own until you can repay everything you owe plus interest. We can get these liens removed and amounts reduced quickly for you. Call us now to find out how.

At Madison Cooke, there is no back room- what you see is what you get. Madison Cooke began business in 1988. From the beginning our services have focused solely on state and local tax specifically: sales, use, business and occupation (B&O), and personal property taxes.

More than 95% of the companies we reviewed were paying too much state and local tax resulting in millions of dollars of savings for our clients. Those savings are the result of helping our clients better understand and manage their state and local tax obligations.

In 95% of our reviews we have identified and successfully recovered tax dollars for our clients. Our services include Audit Management, State & Local Tax Planning and Administration, Consulting, and much more! Review Review ( Reverse Audit ) Madison Cooke will do a comprehensive review of your sales, use, B&O, & personal property tax. No guesswork, no wasted time, just results. Over 95% of the time we find that our client is paying too much state and local tax. Audit Defense Madison Cooke manages state and local tax audits. Our assistance ranges from complete audit management to behind the scenes review of an auditor's work. In either case it begins with a pre-audit review to assess your company's areas of exposure and opportunity. Consulting We obtain determination letters, conduct no-name negotiations, and research specific state and local tax issues. We structure transactions to minimize, defer, or eliminate state and local taxes. We facilitate proactive tax planning. Compliance For most of our personal property clients we file annual tax affidavits with county assessors. Our compliance clients pay less tax and are better able to manage and administer their personal property tax costs. We often provide assistance and training with other aspects of state and local tax compliance and administration. bottom of page FAQ | madisoncooke top of page FAQ Why have an independent state and local tax review? Every taxpayer can benefit from a fresh set of eyes periodically reviewing how state and local taxes are managed. A fresh perspective nearly always results in significant savings. Understanding ever changing state tax laws, agency practices and rulings are essential. But, it's only decades of practical experience in multiple states, jurisdictions and industries that allow our professionals to identify and implement proven tax-reducing strategies. Madison Cooke has a proven 30-year track record of creating substantial state and local tax savings for our clients. What sets Madison Cooke apart? Focus State and local tax isn't just our expertise it's all we do. Practical experience We bring decades of practical experience with state and local sales, use, B&O and personal property tax. Our practical experience involves auditing, accounting, finance, law, and tax administration. Our associates include former senior auditors of the Washington Department of Revenue in addition to former tax managers and tax administrators for manufacturing and high-tech companies. We've been in your shoes and understand your business and concerns from an insider's point of view. Comprehensive approach We don't focus on the low hanging fruit. All Madison Cooke's resources are applied to a thorough and complete review and analysis. Our experience, at many levels and in many industries, has beneficial cross-over effects that other firms can't match. Forensic analysis We are state and local tax detectives. Getting results requires both art and science. Consequently the professional associate who does the review and analysis has to be the same person who knows the law and theory, not a junior associate. Proven results In 95% of our reviews we have identified and successfully recovered tax dollars for our clients. Follow up Comprehensive training is provided after a successful review. We make sure you understand and implement the tax reduction strategies we identify. Value Our commitment is to deliver a service that is dramatically more valuable than the fee we earn. How much of the client's time is normally required? Madison Cooke's experience means we not only find more misplaced tax, it also means you and your staff will spend less time involved in the process. We start any review with a preliminary analysis. That analysis begins with a one-hour meeting to get acquainted with you and your staff and get a feel for your company's systems. After the meeting we spend an additional 2 to 4 hours (depending on the size and complexity of your company) independently reviewing the records we previously requested. When we are finished we go back to our office to continue our analysis. If the preliminary analysis indicates a reason to proceed we will communicate a plan for the completion of the review. If refund issues are discovered Madison Cooke handles all aspects of processing refund claims. That includes scheduling of refund claims, presentation of refund claims to vendors or governmental entities, managing of refund audits, refund negotiation, and any other actions necessary to ensure the refund is received. What types of issues typically arise in a review? No two reviews are exactly alike but there are common themes. Misunderstanding a particular credit, exemption or program: Research & Development in non-traditional high tech and non-high tech taxpayers In other words a client may have an engineering department whose activity falls under the statutory definition of Research & Development. R&D activity carries significant sales/use/B&O tax advantages. Availability and scope of tax deferrals Similarly, identifying eligibility for a deferral has significant tax advantages. Availability and scope of exemptions Similarly, identifying eligibility for an exemption has significant tax advantages. Misunderstanding key elements of the taxpayer's business: Tax decision makers and administrators often lack all the information necessary to classify the revenue stream correctly for B&O tax purposes. How the purchased item is to be used by the taxpayer is more important than the nature of the purchased item. Taxpayers typically look at what is being purchased to determine taxability. Additionally, the tax decision maker usually does not have the information necessary. Often the tax decision makers are not fully informed on what does and does not go into a particular product or how the product is produced. As a consequence items that are ingredients may wind up treated as supplies. Accounting systems are NOT built for excise tax: The use issue described above is often manifested in the accounting system. In other words, tax decisions are made by reference to taxable and non-taxable accounts which reflect the type of purchase rather than the intended use of a particular purpose. Simple errors in charging purchases to the wrong account can result in significant overpayments. For instance a common error is inventory purchases coded to a supplies account. Products and revenue accounts and classifications are often driven by other business issues (i.e. marketing or sales) and do not provide accurate information for excise tax reporting. DOR audits & advice: The DOR is required by statute and inclination to be conservative. Asking the DOR their opinion seldom results in an answer that gives the taxpayer the best result. Excise tax is fact based. The way a question is phrased and the word/terms used are critical in getting the best response. DOR audits, in theory, rely on statistical analysis. Taxpayers face two problems. First, they usually lack in house statistical expertise. Second, they are not aware of how the data provided for the audit can cause serious flaws in audit accuracy Garbage In, Garbage Out. Taxpayers don t have the knowledge or the contacts to resolve difficult issues without going to an administrative appeal. How successful is Madison Cooke? We recover better than 85% of claims filed on behalf of our clients. When engaged by a client to handle a DOR Audit (from the beginning) the client has always received a refund. When engaged by a client to review a DOR audit, on average, for every $1 assessed by the auditor, we obtained $3 of credits. In only two cases did the client owe the state tax and then it was less then $50,000. When engaged to follow another excise tax consultant we have always found at le",

Contact Zenith Tax Resolution, PLLC - Certified Public Accountant in Burien, Washington Tax Resolution Services Burien | Tax Relief, Tax Debt Assistance Tax Resolution Tax Relief | Tax Debt Assistance Here s How We Help You Get Tax Relief The IRS is a financial juggernaut that does not care about the people behind the financial struggles; the IRS simply wants their money, now! With our vast years of hands-on tax experience at Zenith Tax Resolution, PLLC, we help shield our clients from the overbearing government agency to help them overcome financial hurdles and stressful times. Most of this work takes place without you ever stepping foot in our offices. We have technology and resources here to support and represent you no matter where you reside. Of course, you can always come in person to our office if you prefer, whichever is more comfortable and convenient for you. Our Easy 3-Step Process for Tax Resolution: Worry Less, Less Worry At Zenith Tax Resolution, PLLC, we take each client through the following three simple steps, which always lead to a speedy resolution and relief! Step 1: Investigation Our meetings with clients are always confidential. Together, we will review your situation, recent notices, and discuss all available options for resolving your matter. We do this by submitting a power of attorney for immediate relief from the IRS contacts, analyze, and evaluate alternative settlement options. Step 2: Negotiation We stop collection proceedings and prepare & submit back tax returns for the years in question to the IRS. We will also draft paperwork for resolution plans and negotiate for a final resolution. Step 3: Resolution At Zenith Tax Resolution, PLLC, we are on your side! We will strive to obtain the best settlement possible under the current laws. We will request a penalty abatement, and your tax problem is successfully a thing of the past! Currently Not Collectible Offer in Compromise Installment Agreement Innocent Spouse Penalty Abatement Services We Provide to our Clients: Currently Not Collectible Let s be honest with the fact that life sometimes just gets in the way. For taxpayers who have no income, no job, and no assets, the currently not collectible pathway may be a resolution option for you. While placed in currently not collectible status, the IRS cannot enforce any collection actions and no payments must be made by the taxpayer despite any accrual of penalties and interest. Best of all, the tax debt is forgiven after 10 years. Offer in Compromise The Offer in Compromise resolution option is the government s Let s Make A Deal program that allows you to settle your entire tax debt including penalties and interest for less than you owe. The Offer in Compromise essentially wipes the slate clean, allowing the taxpayer to start fresh once again on the right foot. The IRS Code states: We will accept an Offer in Compromise when it is unlikely that we can collect the full amount owed and the amount you offer reasonably reflects the collection potential (Internal Revenue Code 7122). Installment Agreement The installment agreement resolution option is the government s payment plan option that allows the taxpayer easy and affordable monthly payments on your tax liability. The agreement keeps the IRS or the state from levying if the payments are paid as agreed. Without an installment agreement, the IRS or state may take all but a small amount of your paycheck. They can also levy bank accounts and file liens on all of your assets including your home. We may be able to combine an Installment Agreement with a Penalty Abatement to save money and get time to pay the rest. Innocent Spouse The innocent spouse option allows a spouse to be relieved from tax debts owed due to misdeeds or fraud committed by another spouse. This tax problem resolution is based on a two-part set of rules encompassing Innocent Spouse, Separation of Liability, and Equitable Relief. The appropriate portion of the solution depends on each taxpayer s situation. Considerations include whether the spouses are still together, whether there is an understatement or underpayment on the joint tax returns filed, and other factors that can affect mitigation. Penalty Abatement The IRS and state both increase the taxpayer s tax liability by pyramiding penalties and interest to the unpaid tax. In many cases, a taxpayer could pay the tax, but thanks to the penalties and interest, the ballooning balance quickly becomes unmanageable. Penalties and interest might be reduced or eliminated if you can demonstrate reason",

Discover why understanding your Medicare options is vital to your health! We work closely with several of the top insurance carriers to create customized solutions that fit your needs not our bottom line. Whether you re a new Medicare beneficiary or a longtime Medicare Supplement owner, we re here to help you explore your plan options. As part of our commitment to creating you -focused strategies, we offer no-obligation supplemental insurance quotes and FREE educational courses ! Frequently Asked Questions Initial Election Period Expand If you re receiving SS, then you re automatically enrolled and will get your Medicare card in the mail 3 months before your 65th birthday or your 25th month of disability. In most cases, you will automatically get Part A and Part B starting the first day of the month you turn 65. However, if your birthday is on the first day of the month, your coverage will start the first day of the month prior. What does Medicare cover? Expand Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people ages 65+, as well as those younger than 65 with specific disabilities or medical conditions. The insurance has four coverage types, which range from inpatient hospital care to prescription drugs. However, Medicare doesn t cover all medical expenses or extended care, so you may need to consider additional insurance. Click here to schedule a call with a licensed Medicare agent. How much are premiums? Expand For most people, Part A coverage doesn t have a monthly premium, as long as you worked and paid Medicare taxes. Part B monthly premiums start at $170.10 (as of 2022) and go up based on your income. Premiums for Parts C and D vary by plan. Register for our Medicare 101 workshop here to learn more. When do I enroll? Expand Once you receive Social Security benefits or railroad retirement checks, the Social Security Administrations (SSA) sends you enrollment details a few months before your Medicare eligibility begins. From there, the SSA typically enrolls you automatically in both Parts A and B. If you re not getting Social Security or railroad retirement benefits, contact the SSA three months before you turn 65. Medicare Supplement vs. Advantage Plans Expand A Medicare Supplement (Medigap) policy is health insurance sold by private companies to fill in the gaps in Original Medicare. Advantage Plans include benefits at least as good as Original Medicare, but can include additional benefits not otherwise available through Parts A & B (including prescription drug coverage). For more, click here to register for an upcoming Medicare 101 workshop. Registration is free. What if I still have employer coverage? Expand If at age 65 you still have insurance through work, then you do not have to sign up for Medicare as long as your organization has 20 or more employees. If you choose to delay, you can enroll in Medicare, penalty free, once you retire or otherwise, lose your insurance. SPG contracts with multiple major carriers in the marketplace that they feel bring value to their Medicare planning process. SPG does not offer every plan in your area. Currently, they represent 8 organizations that offer 72 products in your area. Please contact medicare.gov, 1-800-MEDICARE, or your local State Health Insurance Program (SHIP) to get information on all of your options.

Our first year with them I was a bit anxious because everything was done by computer. For someone my age that s a bit scary but boy was it fast! The expert we were working with was so kind and understanding of our lack of understanding of some things. We had an internet outage during a subsequent preparation and he helped us figure out how to get information to him when we had to go back to the days of yesterday and he never got upset with us and we were very upset!

  "email 1": "Hi Sandra,\n\nI came across Capital Accounting & Tax Services recently and thought there could be an opportunity to collaborate.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Capital Accounting & Tax Services, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Walking through the process of estate tax preparation\n• Explaining the benefits of tax planning for small businesses\n• Showing how to organize tax documents for easy filing\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nI’d be glad to pull together a short demo; maybe a script or quick sketch; based on what Capital Accounting & Tax Services does best. No pressure, just a chance to preview what it might look and sound like.\n\nIf it feels like a fit, you can reply any time. There’s also a link in my signature in case you want to browse a few previous projects.\n\nThanks for putting something refreshing out there.\n\nWarm regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
