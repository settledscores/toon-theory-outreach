Our Values Empathy Communication Personability Organization Dependability about me I m Vanessa, your personal recruiter . As an HR professional of 22 years and a proud mom, I m on a mission to bring back the human touch that s been missing in recruitment for far too long. My approach is simple: I communicate. I chat with clients, provide empathy to candidates, and always follow up to keep the conversation flowing. Similar to many of us, I was a job seeker once. I know what it s like to have limited information given to you, waiting for a response, and the gut-wrenching feeling of not getting the job. And that s where On the Go HR comes in. Great vision without great people is irrelevant. more about On the Go HR, what it means to me. I created this business to redefine the role of recruiters and help businesses level up their hiring game. Beyond my professional endeavors, my priority is being a mom. Creating On the Go HR was about prioritizing flexibility to be present for my family a lesson learned through the loss of my good friend and colleague, as well as my dad. It s a realization that in the workplace, we are replaceable. Over the past 3 years, I ve built meaningful relationships with clients, made dreams come true for candidates, and challenged the stereotypes surrounding recruiters.

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think On The Go HR could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Showing how contingency recruitment services work for time-sensitive hiring needs\n• Walking through the onboarding process for new hires\n• Explaining the benefits of personalized job seeker support\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to share a quick demo built around something On The Go HR offers. Just a sketch or script; no pressure, no pitch; just curious to see what it might sound like in your voice.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring.

  "email 1": "Hi Michelle,\n\nI stumbled across Radancy and thought I’d reach out.\n\nI'm Trent. I run Toon Theory, a whiteboard animation studio in the UK. We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Radancy, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how to optimize job postings for better candidate attraction\n• Explaining the importance of employer branding in talent acquisition\n• Demonstrating how to use data-driven insights to improve hiring decisions\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nHow about a quick sample built around Radancy's strengths? Ten seconds or so, no strings, no commitments. Just a feeler to see what resonates.\n\nYou’ll find a link to our site in my signature if you’d like to see a few examples. And if anything clicks, I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks for leading with both heart and strategy.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Hello there Michelle,\n\nJust looping back in case this got lost in your inbox. I mentioned how whiteboard animation could support Radancy’s messaging ; and I still believe there’s a great fit here.\n\nThese videos are especially helpful when you’re trying to explain something technical, strategic, or new in a way that sticks.\n\nIf it helps, I’d be happy to put together a short script or quick teaser to show what this could look like.\n\nFeel free to reply if you’d like to explore it. You’ll find examples of our work in my signature.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 3": "Hello there Michelle,\n\nJust reaching out again before I close this thread.

  "email 1": "Hi Zache,\n\nI came across DESIRE & COMPANY CPAs recently and wanted to reach out directly.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor DESIRE & COMPANY CPAs, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Demonstrating how to set up a computerized accounting system\n• Explaining the benefits of internal control reviews and risk assessments\n• Walking through the process of preparing a pre-audit report\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nIf you're curious, I could draft a ten-second teaser or sketch based on what DESIRE & COMPANY CPAs offers. Nothing formal. Just something you can react to, no strings or expectations.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to take this further. You can check out some of our work through the link in my signature as well.\n\nKeep doing what you do, it's making an impact.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Explaining the benefits of leadership training solutions for developing successful leaders\n• Walking through the Wilson Learning Negotiation & Influence process to increase sales effectiveness\n• Demonstrating how to build strategic sales performance through high, wide, deep sales methodology\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nI’d love to put together a quick concept; maybe a script or a short teaser; around one of your key offerings. No strings, just a preview of what's possible with Wilson Learning Corporation's voice behind it.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring.

  "email 1": "Hi Sara,\n\nI stumbled across Deep See Consultants and thought I’d reach out.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Deep See Consultants, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Explaining the benefits of customized leadership development solutions\n• Demonstrating how asynchronous training increases employee engagement\n• Showing how diversity training improves workplace culture\n\nClients often tell us these pieces help reduce bloat, increase clarity, and lead to more meaningful conversions.\n\nI could pull together a quick sketch or sample script based on one of Deep See Consultants’s core offerings. Just a lightweight preview, no expectations; just to show what’s possible.\n\nIf you’re curious about what this might look like, just reach out. There’s a link in my signature with a few examples you can check out, too.\n\nThanks for leading with both heart and strategy.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Hello Sara,\n\nI didn’t want to leave things hanging without checking in. I mentioned how whiteboard animation can be a strong complement to what Deep See Consultants is already doing, especially when you’re communicating ideas that needs a touch of individuality.\n\nIf it’s helpful, I can pull together a short visual sketch or sample script based on one of your key offerings.\n\nNo pressure; just a creative starting point for you to consider.\n\nYou’ll find some of our work linked in my signature.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

Additional Savings Tax Planning Session Tax Planning Session Customers who sign-up for tax planning will save 25% on tax preparation fees. We want to make sure that we help you see the savings through! FAQs Tax Planning Session FAQs Want to know what the process is like? See our FAQ! FAQs FAQs Frequently Asked Questions What should I expect in a Tax Planning Session? Clients should expect two meetings and some homework during the tax planning phase. The first meeting will be an overview of the process, the outline of the tasks, and an agreement to move forward. This is followed by a working session where we review last year's taxes, current year financial results, current year financial forecasts (or provide some guestimates). Often we can provide a questionnaire that the client can fill out in advance that will make the working session go faster. Then finally, we will prepare and present expected savinigs along with an implementatiion plan for making those savings happen. How much time should I plan on this? That's a good question. However, the real question is how much time is $10,000 or more in saviings worth to you? We typically say that clients should expect between 5 and 10 hours to complete the process as inputs to the preparation of the plan. If we save you $10,000 (often a lot more) and you spent 10 hours working on it - that would be $1,000 an hour! What if there are no significant savings? Every client worries that there will be no savings. It is rare and it does happen. If we can't find any savings, then there is no charge for the review. Its that simple. Are the savings a one-time saving? Sometimes yes, but often they are recurring annually - which means they re-occur every. Clients love finding annual savings - its like giving them a pay raise! Is this confidential? Absolutely. We are fearce about protecting our clients and their condifentiality. We treat you the way we expect to be treated.

I was lost with accounting specific to my work industry. I randomly found her contact info and read where some of her clients she worked for were mortgage brokers like myself. I emailed Julianne and asked her for some advice on content. She was generous and quick with her response I would recommend her any day! Quintin Pierce It is a real pleasure working with Financial Foothold, starting from the Founder Julianne, and onboarding specialist Dennice. It has really helped our business during the start-up phase and we look forward to working with them as we grow. Mark Raizen My tax and bookkeeping providers retired and I found myself without professional accountants going into tax season. I met Julianne Autry many years ago and contacted her for a referral. Lucky for me, Financial Foothold was able to take on my small business, tidying up my Quickbooks online and helped me close out my business for 22! A CPA referral has worked seamlessly and my S corporation return is now in process.My company is tiny but I was treated kindly, professionally and quickly! I recommend highly. Leif Anders We have been with Financial Foothold and Julianne for many years now and she has always gone above and beyond to help us with our business. Julianne treats her clients like friends so every interaction with Financial Foothold is enjoyable. She is so responsive with whatever you need. Small businesses have unique needs at times, and JA is always there to help us through it. The professionals that work for her and Financial Foothold are the exact same. We have had the pleasure of working with Shelby since she has taken over our account and daily needs. Shelby is outstanding. She responds to every need lightening fast with an awesome attitude and energy. I cannot possibly give any individual or firm that provides services for small businesses a better recommendation. We feel very fortunate to work with the great people of Financial Foothold. Special thanks to JA and Shelby! RD Straface Such a pleasure working with Julianne and Dennice. I've been doing the bookkeeping for our firm for 20 years and I really wish I would have switched sooner. They make things so easy and work so quickly. So lucky to have found them.

  "email 1": "Hello Marcey,\n\nI just saw Pace & Associates CPAs and thought you might be the right person to speak with.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Pace & Associates CPAs, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Walking through the process of probate accounting for estate administrators\n• Explaining the benefits of fiduciary tax services for business owners\n• Showing how to set up a trust fund for estate planning\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nI'd be happy to draft a ten-second demo around something core to your brand. Totally low-lift, just keen to explore what this could look like with Pace & Associates CPAs's voice behind it.\n\nIf you're open to chatting more, just hit reply.

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think Resources Global Professionals could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Explaining the benefits of next-generation consulting for business growth\n• Showing how on-demand talent can fill skill gaps in a company's workforce\n• Demonstrating how outsourced services can streamline operations and reduce costs\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nHow about a quick sample built around Resources Global Professionals's strengths? Ten seconds or so, no strings, no commitments.

  "email 3": "Hello Kate,\n\nI am still happy to share a quick sketch or demo if it is helpful.

Here are eight methods to help you remedy your tax issues. Installment Contract If you find yourself unable to meet your tax obligations due to financial constraints, you may consider applying for a status known as Currently Not Collectible (CNC). This designation informs the IRS that, at present, you lack the means to settle your tax liabilities. It s imperative to include thorough documentation demonstrating your financial incapacity to repay the debts; failure to do so could result in denial of your request 2. Installment Agreement for Partial Payment If you re unable to manage a short-term tax installment plan, you have the option to negotiate for a partial payment installment arrangement. This allows you to make payments in smaller increments over time. It s important to note that there s usually a maximum timeframe of around ten years for such arrangements. Given the unconventional nature of this payment method and the importance of maintaining a positive relationship with the IRS, consulting with your settlement and resolution officer is advisable to avoid potential IRS assessments. 3. At this time, not collectible If you re burdened with a significant backlog of unpaid taxes, opting for an installment agreement can help you divide the amount into more manageable payments. This approach simplifies the process and alleviates the stress associated with making a large lump-sum payment. By establishing a monthly payment schedule, you can effectively manage your tax obligations over time. 4. Innocent Spouse You can prevent the transfer of tax liability from one spouse to another by filing as an innocent spouse. It s unjust for one spouse to bear responsibility for the other s tax debt, particularly if it predates the marriage. Filing as an innocent spouse provides a means to protect yourself from undue financial burden in such circumstances. 5. In-Compromise Offer If you re unable to settle your entire tax liability due to financial constraints, you have the option to submit an Offer in Compromise (OIC) form. This form notifies the IRS that, while you re willing to pay a reduced amount, you lack the means to pay the full tax bill. Similar to the CNC form, you must substantiate your inability to pay the debt in full with supporting documentation. Upon acceptance of the form, you re required to provide updated financial statements monthly. It s important to note that once your income surpasses the OIC cutoff, you ll be expected to resume paying the full amount. 6. Expired Returns Filing your tax return after the deadline can result in additional fees or interest assessments. However, you can swiftly address this issue by submitting a past-due return form. By doing so, you may qualify for a tax refund on any overpaid amounts, potentially providing additional savings. 7. Penalty Reduction If you ve incurred any type of tax penalty, you have the option to apply for an abatement to reduce or completely eliminate the fines.

Always available, professional, safe atmosphere. I always look forward to teaching my CPR classes there. Eric Miller Instructor, Nation's Best CPR Just what I have been looking for. A beautiful space to work and interact with other local business owners. Easy parking, affordable pricing. Happy to be a member of this space and community. Paul Glendenning Owner, Synergy Contracting LLC The warm and welcoming environment makes networking and getting involved easy. The amount of respect and support University CoWork has for its members and their businesses is impressive. I'm very grateful to be apart of this establishment and work around really great and motivated people. Dylan Jacobs University CoWork has helped my business in SO many ways. The office space has improved my productivity dramatically, allowed me to have a professional setting to meet clients and improved my overall brand. But University CoWork is more than just an office. It opens up a network of opportunities to work with other business owners. I can't say enough about University CoWork! It is an asset to the community. Patrick Taylor CEO, Allevi8 Marketing I can't say enough positive things about University CoWork and how they have made me and my clients feel so at home. Finding office space on the south side has not always been easy. But they have made it easy and exciting. Being so close to the university, downtown Hyde Park and the lake are bonuses. And being able to learn so much about the community and other members' businesses and organizations make it even better! Shemiah Derrick Owner, Profound Peace Psychotherapy Collective An amazing professional setting that provides downtown amenities on the south side of Chicago. It is a great workspace and the people are amazing. Highly recommend this place for business owners, entrepreneurs, or anyone that needs a space to get work done. Steve Nomura United Vision Investment University CoWork has been great for my wealth management and financial investments firm. Located in Merrillville, Indiana, our second location was in downtown Chicago. We wanted a professional office with a more neighborhood feel that is accessible to our south side Chicago clients. When University CoWork opened last year, we immediately closed our expensive downtown office and got a $95 flexible membership, and then upgraded to a $295 dedicated desk. This allows us to do occasional work on the south side of Chicago. We now have a professional presence, and can meet our clients at our office closer to where they work and live. I love the phone and meeting rooms. Great technology. We are able to offer our clients parking and coffee in our beautiful new space. Our firm also hosts investment events in the University CoWork boardroom, classroom, and event spaces. Sharon Mallory CEO, SDM Investments Every aspect of University CoWork is superb! Since moving to Woodlawn in 2007, I have searched for suitable local office space for my law firm. I was happy to learn about University CoWork last year and eager to see the space and its amenities. The private offices, co-working spaces and common areas were all thoughtfully designed and built with highest quality finishes. University CoWork also offers far more than just professional office space. University CoWork is a welcoming community that monthly hosts networking and small business development programs and other events. I feel fortunate to be part of this vibrant community and urge those looking for local office space to visit University CoWork. Andrea Vag Managing Attorney, Vag Law LLC David Lubin was key to my expansion from a Chicago design firm to a branded North American design firm. He helped me acquire national and international clients during the most difficult business environment since the Great Depression. University CoWork helped me maintain consistent work during the pandemic, even during a pandemic construction depression in our territory. He propelled me to engage remote workers in the U.S. and abroad to keep my business growing despite the severe shortage of labor in the Chicago area. As other service businesses contracted, David s encouragement propelled me to leverage our tech stack, deep and unique subject matter expertise, and international contacts to prosper in uncertain times. Joel Berman Owner/Principal, Berman Architecture &. Design, Ltd. The warm and welcoming environment makes networking and getting involved easy. The amount of respect and support University Cowork has for its members and their businesses is impressive. I m very grateful to be apart of this establishment and work around really great and motivated people. Dr. Anancia Stafford Ed.D, LCPC, NCC Owner, Inner Peaces Counseling and Consulting LLC University CoWork is a state-of-the-art workspace that is designed to cover all of your business needs. If you want to have a conference room set up for Zoom meetings with all the latest technology they've got you covered.

Maybe you need a quiet professional setting to get some work done, no problem here. They have it all with amazing facilities and staff!

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Sanguine Strategic Advisors, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how to optimize marketing budgets for maximum ROI\n• Demonstrating how to increase online visibility through social media\n• Explaining the benefits of SEO for small business owners\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nI’d love to put together a quick concept; maybe a script or a short teaser; around one of your key offerings. No strings, just a preview of what's possible with Sanguine Strategic Advisors's voice behind it.\n\nIf you’re curious about what this might look like, just reach out.

READ MORE Create a Plan for Your Loved Ones Wills The most basic way to handle your estate is by creating a will. This legally binding document is a way to inform your loved ones how to distribute your assets and how to handle your estate after you have passed. There are many benefits to having a will, like controlling your healthcare choices and choosing a suitable guardian for a minor in your care. To create a will, contact us in either Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, or Los Angeles, California. Trusts A trust is similar to a will in that you are able to allocate assets and instruct your family on your final wishes after your passing. However, there are more benefits a trust has that a will does not. With a trust, you may be able to avoid probate entirely, which will save time and money after your passing. If you are looking to create a comprehensive trust, reach out to us at Moses Estate Planning. We're ready to help you set your loved ones up for success.

READ MORE Business Entity Formation If you are looking to open a business, our attorney can help you establish an entity and find a structure that works for you. READ MORE Create a Plan for Your Loved Ones Wills The most basic way to handle your estate is by creating a will. This legally binding document is a way to inform your loved ones how to distribute your assets and how to handle your estate after you have passed. There are many benefits to having a will, like controlling your healthcare choices and choosing a suitable guardian for a minor in your care. To create a will, contact us in either Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, or Los Angeles, California. Trusts A trust is similar to a will in that you are able to allocate assets and instruct your family on your final wishes after your passing. However, there are more benefits a trust has that a will does not. With a trust, you may be able to avoid probate entirely, which will save time and money after your passing. If you are looking to create a comprehensive trust, reach out to us at Moses Estate Planning. We're ready to help you set your loved ones up for success.

  "email 1": "Hi Travor,\n\nI came across Moses Estate Planning recently and thought there could be an opportunity to collaborate.\n\nI'm Trent. I run Toon Theory, a whiteboard animation studio in the UK. We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Moses Estate Planning, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Explaining how to protect assets from creditors and lawsuits\n• Walking through the process of setting up a special needs trust for a loved one\n• Demonstrating the benefits of Medicaid trusts for seniors\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nHow about a quick sample built around Moses Estate Planning's strengths?

Save Money On Your Investments Cost Segregation It is important to know what goes into Cost Segregation Studies. Engineering-Based Cost Segregation is the IRS-approved method for accelerating building depreciation for commercial and residential rental properties. A proper Engineering-Based Cost Segregation study identifies what should be correctly classified as tangible personal property or land improvements rather than real property, depreciated over 39 years (or 27.5 years for residential rental property). This means that all types of investment properties may qualify for a cost segregation study. Our Cost Segregation Process A High Level Overview We send you a proposal, and you approve it. We gather information on the property. A cost segregation specialist will conduct a site visit. We do all take-offs and costing. We assemble and deliver the final detailed report. Engineering-Based Vs. Residual Studies Our engineering-based cost segregation studies are far better than the residual studies most other companies perform. See What Makes Us Different! We go the extra mile for our clients by providing complete detail for both the short-life and long-life building components. This offers multiple benefits: It allows for the reconciliation of all project costs, as required by the IRS, keeping you safe in the event of an audit. It gives our clients and tax professionals the ability to track and retire short and long-life building components that are removed from service. Your tax benefits begin in the first tax year and continue throughout the identified assets depreciable life. As long as you own your property, an M&E Cost Segregation Study will continue to provide tax benefits every time a building component is replaced/taken out of service. Find Out How You Can Save on Your Taxes With M&E Cost Segregation Get a no-cost, no-obligation estimate to start your cost segregation study journey! Request a Proposal Our Engineers have completed thousands of cost segregation studies in countless situations. New Acquisition Studies/Purchase Price Allocations Suppose you recently purchased or are planning to purchase an existing property. In that case, we can help make your new acquisition more affordable by conducting an Engineering Based Cost Segregation study for the property. This will enable specific building components to be reclassified as tangible personal property or land improvements that can be depreciated over 5, 7, or 15 years rather than real property that is depreciated over 39 years (27.5 years for residential rental property). Due to the shorter recovery periods and accelerated depreciation methods, items reclassified as tangible personal property and land improvements generate faster depreciation write-offs, thus increasing your cash flow. Our Cost Segregation experts will also assign a depreciable life and a project cost to every component within the property. This will give you the ability to write off short and long-life assets that are retired in the years following the study. New Construction Studies No matter what phase you are at with your new construction project, it is beneficial to conduct an Engineering-Based Cost Segregation Study to minimize taxes and maximize ROI. Contact us today. Look-Back Studies Even if you purchased your property several years ago, you still have the ability to conduct a cost segregation study and receive the benefits of your investment in the current tax year. It can be greatly beneficial if you have owned the property for ten years or less. Leasehold Improvement Studies An Engineering Based Cost Segregation Study can be incredibly beneficial if you lease your space but have made leasehold improvements of $500,000 or more (or plan to in the future). M&E Cost Segregation can conduct an initial evaluation based on some basic information and prepare a cost vs. benefit analysis to lay out the expected tax benefits and the fixed fees required to complete the study. Then you can make an educated decision on whether to go forward with the analysis. Have You Replaced Any Structural Components of Your Building? If so, you could substantially benefit from an Asset Retirement Study.

  "email 1": "Hi Paul,\n\nI came across Pendleton Tax & Accounting Services recently and wanted to reach out directly.\n\nI'm Trent. I run Toon Theory, a whiteboard animation studio in the UK. We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Pendleton Tax & Accounting Services, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how to reconcile bank and credit card accounts\n• Explaining the importance of reviewing receivables and payables\n• Walking through the process of generating monthly financial statements\n\nClients often tell us these pieces help reduce bloat, increase clarity, and lead to more meaningful conversions.\n\nIf you're curious, I could draft a ten-second teaser or sketch based on what Pendleton Tax & Accounting Services offers. Nothing formal. Just something you can react to, no strings or expectations.\n\nI’d be happy to chat if you’re interested. Just reply anytime, and feel free to check out some of our work through the link in my signature.\n\nKeep doing what you do, it's making an impact.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",

Click here to go directly to the contact form What People Are Saying Client Reviews My experience with Justin Sundberg started a couple of years ago when I needed an Estate Tax return done in a time crunch situation. With very short notice, Justin was able to have it done prior to the needed date. Since that time I ve discuss business situations/the tax implications thereof with Justin and had tax returns, both personal and estate, done by him. I like the fact that he does his research well, if there is any question and/or options available, he takes the time and effort to verify the correct options and then fully explain them to you. Justin has the skill of listening, a skill that I ve found not all accountants have, and a trait that I find critical if one is going to discuss complicated financial matters. I ve found Justin reliable, thoughtful, timely, accurate and very professional as I trust you will also. | Source George E. | Executive & Venture Capitalist (but a private person, so off the grid) Justin has been such a godsend. Between starting a small business in 2009 and getting married, my tax situation was complicated. He found errors on my 2009 return, amended it, AND found a way to accelerate some overhead expenses to increase my deductions. He has saved me and my husband a LOT of money and is always looking for ways that I can improve my bookkeeping. I also like his paperless capabilities, as we can send tax documents electronically and securely. If you want a responsive, well-qualified CPA who provides high quality work for a fair price, call Justin! | Source Dr. Barb Kaiser | Doctor of chiropractic, focused on neurospinal correction Working with Justin is always an informative experience. He is committed to sharing his knowledge, money-saving business tips, and expertise as a way of supporting his clients, prospective clients, and his peers. In an otherwise \"dry\" field of work, Justin has a way of providing tough information in a light, fun way. I enjoy Justin's professionalism and depend on his deep knowledge of the tax system. | Source KimAileen White, MA | HR Support | Customized Outplacement | Job Transition Justin is my go-to CPA for start-up and small business needs. He should be yours as well. Justin is as personable as he is professional. I recommend Justin to friends and family without hesitation. | Source David J. Holt | Healthcare & Business Attorney | Patient Advocate | Entrepreneur | Cofounder at miVoyce.com Justin Sundberg, at Sundberg Tax and Consulting, provides excellent professional services. I have been impressed with Justin's depth of expertise and knowledge regarding small business finances and tax preparation. Furthermore, Justin combines that expertise with his strong drive for customer service and warm people skills. As a client, Justin built my knowledge-base, put me at ease, and gave me clear directions and responses to quickly address complicated issues. Justin's top notch service, genuine and kind personality and his work ethic have earned my loyalty and my recommendation. | Source Jo Miller, GPC, CSMS | Grant Professional Certified - Federal Grants and Nonprofit Consultant We hired Justin to help with our business Taxes last year and Justin brought a wealth of experience to the table. He was extremely responsive about all our questions, took his time to understand our needs, and made a huge effort to make sure we were happy with the process. We highly recommend his work and will continue to use his services! | Source Fuyei Xaykaothao | Associate Director of Programming Development and Partnerships at Saint Paul Urban Tennis Justin is a fantastic accountant who has taken so much stress out of running my own business. I rely on him for sound accounting advice and direction. He's incredibly knowledgeable and trustworthy. And he's fun to work with - how often do you hear that about an accountant?? HIGHLY recommend him! | Source Jennifer Dunn | Experienced Realtor and Public Policy Consultant/Researcher I was referred to Justin to help settle an IRS dispute. Hiring him has paid dividends over and over. Not only did he save me 50% on the five digit tax bill, but he also reviewed and cleaned up all my previous years returns, restructured my business to an S-Corp, and now he takes care of my book keeping and payroll. Justin listens to your needs and goals and is knowledgeable and a wide variety of business and tax topics.

Socials: bottom of page Finding A Good Accountant | Staten Island NY | Marocola Elite Solutions Inc top of page Finding a Good Accountant Who Understands Your Business While there is no shortage of accountants in the world, not all accountants are created equal. Every business is different, and you need to be sure that your accountant properly understands the needs of your business if you want to be successful. Outsourcing your bookkeeping is a big risk. You can t do everything by yourself and at some point, you ll likely need a professional to manage your books so you can focus on more important matters. But you can trust just anyone with that responsibility. Here are a few tips on finding a good accountant who will help you succeed: Find an accountant who understands your industry: Every industry is different and not all accountants are fit to understand the nuances of every business. An accountant with experience primarily in real estate may not be the best to handle a restaurant and vice versa. It s important to look for a tax professional with experience in your industry or at least an understanding of what is needed. Find an accountant who understands your tax needs: No two businesses are the same and to find a good accountant you ll have to know what kinds of tax services you need. If you are a company with 50 employees, you will need an accountant who understands payroll tax. If you re a solopreneur who travels extensively, you will need someone adept at tracking expenses and calculating possible deductions. You will likely need a variety of services from your accountant and it s best to have a handle on what you need before seeking out a professional. Find an accountant you trust on a personal level: You don t have to be best friends, but it s important to find an accountant you feel you can trust. You should at very least have a good report with your CPA because you ll be communicating with them a lot. If you have to grit your teeth every time you make a phone call, it s wise to look for someone else. Finding a good accountant when outsourcing your bookkeeping is tough, but not impossible. Give us a call at Marocola Elite Solutions if you want to expedite the process and book a consultation with a team of accountants who will check all these boxes. bottom of page Small Business Accountant Near Me | Staten Island NY | Marocola Elite Solutions top of page Small Business Accountant Near Me The Best Small Business Accountant Near You Proper accounting is vital to the success of any business.

Simplifying the Denver Home Loan Process We Provide Denver Mortgage Loans With A Personal Touch We know the loan process can feel overwhelming, but the Hunter Lending home mortgage team will explain the process and answer any questions you may have during any step along the way. There are six main steps in the home loan process. 1. Pre-qualification: We gather information about your credit, income, and assets to make a financial determination about how much house you may be able to afford. If you are refinancing the loan on your existing home, then the pre-qualification process should help you decide whether refinancing will help meet your financial goals. At this time, we will discuss various fees and down payment options. 2. Application: Once you find a home to purchase or determine you would like to refinance a current property, you will complete a mortgage application for a customized loan program and supply all of the required documentation for underwriting. Apply Today 3. Underwriting: The underwriter will determine whether the application package prepared by Hunter Lending has all the required information. Once the underwriter initially approves the loan, our processors will work with you to meet all requirements for final loan approval. Read More 4. Processing: Hunter Lending will order the appraisal (if needed), title, and homeowners insurance and compile the other items required to move the loan to close 5. Closing: After final loan approval, Hunter Lending will review the loan settlement figures with you and coordinate the signing of the closing documents with the title company. We will also discuss options for supplying any cash due at closing (cashier s check vs. wire) and signing location (at the title company vs. remotely at the location of your choosing). 6. Post Closing: Hunter Lending will keep you aware of interest rate fluctuations and possible cost savings with refinancing or new loan programs. Our commitment to you does not end with a loan closing.

Each time I shopped around, and they got me the best rates of anyone EVERYTIME. They make the process so damn easy, it s hard to want to go anywhere else. After this last refi, I don t believe I ll be wasting my time with anyone else. Bravo gentlemen A+++ Jake Dine We have worked with Ryan and Jim at Hunter Lending now two times.

Simplifying the Denver Home Loan Process We Provide Denver Mortgage Loans With A Personal Touch We know the loan process can feel overwhelming, but the Hunter Lending home mortgage team will explain the process and answer any questions you may have during any step along the way. There are six main steps in the home loan process. 1. Pre-qualification: We gather information about your credit, income, and assets to make a financial determination about how much house you may be able to afford. If you are refinancing the loan on your existing home, then the pre-qualification process should help you decide whether refinancing will help meet your financial goals. At this time, we will discuss various fees and down payment options. 2. Application: Once you find a home to purchase or determine you would like to refinance a current property, you will complete a mortgage application for a customized loan program and supply all of the required documentation for underwriting. Apply Today 3. Underwriting: The underwriter will determine whether the application package prepared by Hunter Lending has all the required information. Once the underwriter initially approves the loan, our processors will work with you to meet all requirements for final loan approval. Read More 4. Processing: Hunter Lending will order the appraisal (if needed), title, and homeowners insurance and compile the other items required to move the loan to close 5. Closing: After final loan approval, Hunter Lending will review the loan settlement figures with you and coordinate the signing of the closing documents with the title company. We will also discuss options for supplying any cash due at closing (cashier s check vs. wire) and signing location (at the title company vs. remotely at the location of your choosing). 6. Post Closing: Hunter Lending will keep you aware of interest rate fluctuations and possible cost savings with refinancing or new loan prog",

I take pride in thoroughly documented and demonstrated journal entries, reconciliations, and workpapers so that all elements of your financials are proven and tie-back to source documentation.

Not everyone has the vision and drive required to successfully take a concept and bring it to life. And the thought of hiring external staff, like a bookkeeper, can feel a bit daunting. Early on, when you re just starting out, it s manageable to track everything yourself or use basic software. But as your business grows, you might find that managing all those invoices, payments, and expenses becomes overwhelming, explains Steven Kibbel, certified financial planner and founder of Kibbel Financial . I ve seen small business owners who wait too long to address this and end up with errors in their books, missing payments to vendors, or even misreporting revenue. SEE ALSO: The 20 best tools for starting your own business Sure, you might pride yourself on running a lean business, but a good bookkeeper should be seen as an investment, one that helps you track and retain more of your hard-earned money and frees up your time to focus on what you re best at. If you ve been wondering whether or not you need outside help to track and manage your small business expenses and income, you ll want to read on. Here are the tell-tale signs that it might be time to hire a bookkeeper, according to a certified financial planner and a small business tax advisor. 1. When you re unable to keep track of the inflow and outflow of cash As your business grows, managing your own books can quickly become overwhelming. You might lose track of who owes you money, miss vendor invoice deadlines, and struggle to accurately track cash flow, says Alex Cook, VP of Small Business Tax at Block Advisor . Reliable cash flow management is crucial for making informed business decisions that ensure long-term success. However, if bookkeeping isn't your strength, it can hinder your progress. According to Cook, untangling financial messes on your own can consume valuable time that could be better spent on sales and revenue generation. If this sounds familiar, it might be time to outsource your accounting to a trusted provider. 2. When bookkeeping starts eating into your time Another big trigger is when bookkeeping starts eating into the time you should be spending on running and growing your business. I worked with a client who owned a small retail shop, and she told me she was staying up until midnight every night trying to reconcile her accounts. That s time she could have spent sourcing new inventory or marketing her business, explains Kibbel. Hiring a book",

It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor CI Solutions, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Explaining how six sigma consulting reduces defects by 90% in 6 months\n• Showing how strategy deployment cuts project timelines in half\n• Visualizing lean process improvements that boost employee productivity by 30%\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nHow about a quick sample built around CI Solutions's strengths? Ten seconds or so, no strings, no commitments. Just a feeler to see what resonates.\n\nYou’ll find a link to our site in my signature if you’d like to see a few examples.

Accounting Services Accounting Services It s a fact: Working with a business advisor dramatically increases the odds of success for your business. And with 50% of businesses failing in their first five years (Source: SBA), it just makes good business sense to find ways to increase your chances of success with your business. Finding the Perfect Blend of Accounting Skills and Expertise Every business is different when it comes to the type and level of accounting services needed. Some small businesses may only need bookkeeping services, while others benefit from many layers of accounting skills from bookkeepers to Chief Financial Officers. If your business is in the small to mid-market range, it may not make sense to have a full-time CFO, a full-time controller, and multiple bookkeepers with all the full-time salaries and benefits in your accounting department. The good news is you can still get the advice of these high-level accounting skill sets while paying only for what you need. We work with business owners like you to create a customized package based on your company s unique accounting needs. How We Can Help Your Business Accounting System Selection Having the right accounting system can make all the difference in the world. We re familiar with many accounting software options and can help you find the best fit for your business. If you ve outgrown your current solution, we can help you manage the transition without missing a beat. One secret in boosting accounting productivity is to make sure your accounting software is set up and customized correctly. We learn your requirements so we can tailor the accounting software to your business and reporting needs. Plus, we can train your staff on the new system so they can be up and running in no time. Accounting System Selection, Setup, Customization and Training Workflow Efficiencies Streamlined data gathering and entry Process Development and Improvement The accounting function is necessary in every business, but it shouldn t be cumbersome or inefficient. We can take a look at areas within your accounting system that are costing you more than they should be. These could include areas of duplicate data entry, time spent on manual reports, and bottlenecks in general. We ll suggest improvements that can save you time and money and keep your bookkeeping bill as low as possible. Are there any areas in your accounting functions that are undocumented? We can help you write a procedures manual for those areas. Good documentation is the key to good training, consistency, and controls. Let Hughes Walker Group suggest efficiency recordkeeping workflows for some of these key elements of your business: Invoicing & sales receipts Expenses & expense reporting Payroll Accounting controls Profitability Analysis Do you wonder which product or service line is the most profitable for you? We can perform an analysis of profitability by location, product, employee, or whatever grouping is meaningful for you. This information will help you make better decisions about your revenue mix and make your business more profitable in the long term. While most accountants stick to cursory expense reviews, we prefer to go deeper. We can help you identify costs that may be outside your industry norms, discover areas where your pricing might not cover your costs, and root out profit margins that should be higher. If you maintain inventory in your business, we can help you lower carrying costs, determine out-of-stock conditions, and identify obsolete items. Is your business project-based with job costing requirements? We can help you make sure it s set up right, help you create more accurate estimates, and accelerate cash flow with timely progress billings. We go beyond traditional services by providing: Monthly financial reports (Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow) Regular business reviews (Either monthly, quarterly, or annual) Industry related key performance indicators to call attention to financial issues and inconsistencies Cash flow projections Loan package creation Budgeting and forecasting Profitability Analysis Committed to the Relationship It can be difficult to find advice when you are in business for yourself. As a fellow small business owner, we can act as a sounding board for your business ideas and provide a fresh, experienced perspective. We can serve as an unbiased listener for your ideas and concerns. There are so many benefits to hiring a bookkeeping company to take care of your books. Peace of mind Relief Better business insight Tax time is a little less taxing More profits Focus How to Get Started How to Get Started The perfect synergy between a business owner and the accounting team occurs when two things happen: 1) the team gains a deeper knowledge about your specific business, and 2) the business owner grows in their financial knowledge about their business. This is when the magic really starts to happen for the business, and it improves over time. Our goal is to become a true partner for your business by providing you with the right mix of accounting services for you and your business.

Mediation is a voluntary process that gives the individuals the opportunity to describe the issues, discuss their interests, understandings, and feelings. In addition, mediation provides individuals with information and creative ideas to resolve disputes. Integrity Consulting Solutions facilitates mediations in the areas of civil and workplace conflict. ** Virtual mediations are available. Creative. Impartial. Patient. Mediation I believe that conflict resolution is where listening, logical thought, and empathy meet. Only then can participants have productive dialogue where solutions are mutually accepted. Investigation There is an old saying , there s two sides to every story. In an investigation, there are usually many sides to many stories, and sometimes many sides to the same story. That is why getting to the root of the issue is so critical. Integrity Consulting Solutions conducts investigations including, but not limited to claims of discrimination, harassment, and bias that get to the root of the issue. Integrity Consulting Solutions provides clear and concise presentation of the facts and can offer recommendations to move forward while remaining objective and respectful of all parties involved. Credible. Perceptive. Thorough. Investigation \"Getting to the root of the issue, lays the foundation for understanding what has happened.\" Human Resources We are always engaging, connecting, sharing knowledge, ideas, and experiences. Integrity Consulting Solutions partners with organizations on coaching and counseling, group facilitation and training to enhance these interactions. In addition, Integrity Consulting Solutions provides diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) strategy development, training and measurement to align DEI to business growth. Authentic. Flexible. Resourceful. Human Resources When we listen and celebrate what is both common and different, we become a wiser, more inclusive, and better organization. - P.

We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas.

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Connections IT Services, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Visualizing how technology training boosts employee proficiency in 6 weeks\n• Explaining how managed IT services reduce network downtime by 90%\n• Showing how contingent staffing fills talent gaps in 30 days\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nI'd be happy to draft a ten-second demo around something core to your brand.

Employment Based EB-3 Visas What is the EB-3 Visa Program? The EB-3 Visa Program, a third preference employment visa, grants permanent residency to skilled workers, unskilled workers, and professionals. It has less strict requirements than EB-1 and EB-2 visas but often longer wait times. Annually, 28.6% of employment green cards are allocated to EB-3, accounting for about 40,000 visas. Additionally, no more than 7% of EB-3 visas can go to applicants from any single country, leading to longer wait times for nationals from high-application countries like India and China. Despite potential delays, the EB-3 Visa Program is a valuable pathway to achieving permanent residency in the U.S. through employment.

A bookkeeper is responsible for recording financial transactions, maintaining accurate financial records, reconciling bank statements, and preparing financial reports. They ensure that financial data is organized and up to date. What is the difference between a bookkeeper & an accountant? Bookkeepers focus on recording and organizing financial transactions, while accountants interpret, analyze, and report on financial data. Accountants also prepare tax returns and provide strategic financial advice. How often should financial records be updated? It is best practice to update financial records regularly, typically weekly or monthly, to ensure accuracy and make informed business decisions. What is a bank reconcilliation? Bank reconciliation is the process of comparing a company s financial records with bank statements to ensure all transactions match and identify discrepancies. How do bookkeepers help with taxes? Bookkeepers track income and expenses, maintain organized records, and generate financial reports that help accountants prepare tax filings efficiently. Can a bookkeeper prepare financial statements? Yes, bookkeepers prepare financial statements such as profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. However, accountants typically review and analyze these reports. What are accounts payable & accounts recievable? Accounts Payable (AP): Money a business owes to suppliers or vendors. Accounts Receivable (AR): Money owed to a business by its customers. How can bookkeepers prevent financial errors? Bookkeepers can prevent errors by maintaining accurate records, performing regular reconciliations, implementing internal controls, and using accounting software with automation features. What industries need bookkeeping services? All businesses need bookkeeping, including retail, healthcare, construction, hospitality, non-profits, and professional services. Freelancers and independent contractors also benefit from bookkeeping services. Can bookkeepers work remotely? Yes, many bookkeepers offer remote services using cloud-based accounting software and secure file-sharing platforms. What should businesses look for in a bookkeeper? Businesses should look for bookkeepers with relevant experience, industry knowledge, proficiency in accounting software, attention to detail, and strong communication skills. How much do bookkeeping services cost? The cost of bookkeeping varies based on factors such as experience, business size, transaction volume, and whether the bookkeeper is hired in-house or outsourced.

She prepared the job offers to the new candidates and got background checks done as well. I find interviewing very stressful so to have all of this taken off of my plate has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. She knows what questions to ask and what to look for in a candidate. With her help, we hired TWO great candidates for our growing business.

Alysa did not only execute on what was agreed upon, but also was able to clean up some items that needed attention. I would recommend A People Partner a hundred times over. I left for and came back from my maternity leave with no stress at all. Very much appreciated!

The potential costs of response to claims, lawsuits, and loss of credibility with employees and customers make this a top priority in most organizations. Our team is up to date and can work with you to find the practical path to compliant management. Employee Surveys Do you actually know what your employees are thinking? Have you shared your thoughts with them? Employee surveys provide a road map for problem solving, facilitate communication in organizations, address employee relations concerns, and provide a baseline from which change can be made. We can help you develop questions and answers, reports, the roadmap to make change, and the communication necessary for achievements that balance organization capability with employee interests. Did an employee just leave your office or have they sent you an email outlining a complaint or a concern about a work situation that makes them uncomfortable and now you are wondering what to do? We can discuss the situation and help you determine the next steps. If an objective investigation is needed, we can complete a thorough workplace investigation, on any topic, including an assessment of the situation, questions for the parties involved, and documentation and presentation of the findings. Are you feeling a little, or a lot, out of your depth? Do you just need a quick sounding board to confirm you are headed in the right direction? We have the HR answers including compliance and practical application in every aspect of HR including strategic planning, recruitment, employee engagement, employee retention, learning and development, total rewards, the structure of your HR department, organizational effectiveness and development, workforce management, employee and labor relations, diversity and inclusion, health and safety, and the laws and rules that govern it all. How long has the creation or revising of that human resource policy, procedure, or guideline been sitting on your to-do list? Wouldn t it be nice to check it off the list? Contact one of our consultants for an estimate; we can create customized applications, handbooks, ADA, leave policies and forms, performance management, separation, and much more.

The schedule below reflects scheduled topics, although breaking news may pre-empt a scheduled topic or shorten the time we spend on a scheduled topic. All webinar times are 9:00-10:00 a.m. ET bottom of page www.boldlygohr.com/businessservices top of page HR CONSULTING You can have comprehensive, professional HR support from certified and licensed HR professionals for a fraction of the cost of hiring an in-house HR manager. Ask us how! When You Work With GO-HR, You Can Expect: Initial consultation We take this time to get to know you and understand your unique business and employees. This meeting includes learning about your various systems and processes already in place and discussing options to help you better utilize what you re already investing in. Ongoing relationship When you hire GO-HR, you hire a team of professionals, not an account manager. This allows us to build knowledge about your company throughout our organization so we can better assist your organization. Trust and respect We work best when we become part of your team. For some clients, that includes participating in their team meetings, having dedicated office space on site, having log-ins to HR-related systems, and being part of your annual and ongoing strategy and planning sessions. We customize how we work with every employer, from on-demand hourly consulting to customized retainer packages that start as low as five hours per month. If you re interested in learning more about our retainer packages and the advantages and cost savings of a retainer over our open rate, please contact us today! Let s be honest, nobody likes HR, but everybody needs it. We can live with not being the life of the party, but can you live without us? HR is so much more than the compliance cops. A Good HR Partner Does Help You Stay Compliant, But We Also Help With: Business strategy and planning. Employee engagement Training and development. Benefits planning. Recruiting and onboarding. Performance reviews. Compensation, bonuses, and incentives. Handbooks and policy development. Operations integration. And yes, compliance. Every business is different. Don t let the big payroll companies or PEOs tell you otherwise. Your business has unique needs and personalities and a \"one-size\" approach to managing your HR does not work for your company that is far from one size. bottom of page Investigations | go-hr top of page WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS Sexual harassment and discrimination investigations are a reality in the workplace. Between 2018 and 2021, the EEOC received over 98,000 charges alleging harassment and over 27,000 charges alleging sexual harassment. Women reported 78.2% of sexual harassment cases and 62.2% of all harassment charges. Often, charges of harassment and other discrimination are filed in the same charge. In a 3-year period, the EEOC recovered nearly $300 million for individuals. Why Should You Use An Outside Resource To Conduct Your Workplace investigations? Outside investigators allow the employer to remain neutral and fair, reducing potential conflicts of interest and negative public perception. Employees who are asked to provide statements during an investigation tend to be more comfortable and more willing to be truthful and accurate with outside investigators than they would with an internal investigator who is known to them. Undue stress and potential bias are eliminated, especially if the investigation is of senior/executive leadership. It will allow in-house counsel to serve as a material witness if they did not conduct the investigation but did witness the incident. It allows the company and outside counsel to maintain attorney-client privilege if outside counsel focuses on providing legal advice and does not conduct the investigation. An outside investigator can alleviate the potential risk of a retaliation lawsuit and the company may call them as a witness during litigation. Outside investigators have been trained and have frequently conducted these types of investigations, whereas internal investigators may conduct investigations less frequently and therefore have less experience. Sharon DeLay, SPHR, SHRM-SCP is a Certified EEO Investigator and holds SHRM s Workplace Investigations Specialty Credential. In addition to training and development in investigations, she has completed hundreds of hours of investigations related to claims of discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace discord, and unfair workplace treatment.

We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor GO-HR, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Visualizing the onboarding process with zero paperwork and same-day access for new hires\n• Explaining how compliance support saves small businesses from costly lawsuits\n• Showing how customized HR solutions reduce employee turnover by 30% in 6 months\n\nThese animations don’t just explain, they convert; Many of our past clients see a big lift in engagement, trust, and sales.\n\nI’d be glad to pull together a short demo; maybe a script or quick sketch; based on what GO-HR does best.

What People Are Saying client Testimonials What People Are Saying Client Testimonials We have partnered with LMSolutions since 2019 for Information Security remediation planning and tracking, as well as cybersecurity awareness training. With not having an IT person on staff, LMSolutions makes it easier for us to understand and remediate audit findings. Their cybersecurity training is great too! Bradley Mader, President, KH Credit Union We highly recommend LeBrun Management Solutions as a cybersecurity consultant. LMS has greatly improved our staff cybersecurity awareness and training processes, and in addition, they have provided us with excellent member cybersecurity educational content as well. On top of that, they also work closely with our IT staff in order to regularly assess our regulatory compliance in terms of IT security. Greg Kidwell, President, Pathways Financial Credit Union Our primary customer being the Department of Defense, DLA issued a requirement for certifiable cyber security . We selected LMS and we are glad we did. The team catered to exactly what we needed to be in compliance with NIST 800-171 and CMMC. We saw immediate results in an area with which we had very little experience. Their approach to training was organized, interactive and quite frankly entertaining. LMS provided a new level of certification and understanding for our business. We would highly recommend their services, as with LMS, you are treated with the utmost of courtesy, promptness, and professionality. Chri",

Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Visualizing diversity spend tracking to ensure inclusive hiring practices\n• Explaining how employer of record services simplify benefits and compliance\n• Showing how recruitment process outsourcing fills open roles 30% faster\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nWould you be open to seeing a quick script or ten-second sketch built with OSS Tech in mind? No expectations; just interested in showing you what’s possible.\n\nIf you're open to chatting more, just hit reply.

Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Visualizing how outsourced HR support frees up 10 hours of management time per week\n• Explaining how custom HR consulting aligns your business strategy with employee goals\n• Showing how HR audits uncover hidden compliance risks in 60 seconds\n\nClients often tell us these pieces help reduce bloat, increase clarity, and lead to more meaningful conversions.\n\nI’d love to put together a quick concept; maybe a script or a short teaser; around one of your key offerings. No strings, just a preview of what's possible with Prescott HR's voice behind it.\n\nJust reach out if you’d like to continue the conversation. You’ll find a few previous projects linked in the signature below.\n\nThanks for putting something refreshing out there.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Founder @ Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",

I run Toon Theory, a whiteboard animation studio in the UK. We make simple, animated explainer videos that help people understand dense ideas. They're great for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Outsourced Accounting Service, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Visualizing how ERP implementation streamlines project workflows in 60 days\n• Explaining how outsourced accounting reduces project cost overruns by 15%\n• Showing how CRM integration automates client communication for AEC project managers\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nIf you're curious, I could draft a ten-second teaser or sketch based on what Outsourced Accounting Service offers. Nothing formal. Just something you can react to, no strings or expectations.\n\nJust reach out if you’d like to continue the conversation. You’ll find a few previous projects linked in the signature below.\n\nThanks for putting something refreshing out there.\n\nWarmly,\nTrent — Founder @ Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nWhiteboard videos your customers will actually remember.",

I still believe whiteboard animation could support something Outsourced Accounting Service is working on, whether that is a pitch, process, or product.\n\nIf you would like to test the waters, I am happy to sketch something out to show what it might look like.\n\nYou will find past examples linked in my signature.

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor People Group, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Explaining how benefits administration boosts employee satisfaction by 20%\n• Showing how payroll outsourcing saves small businesses 5 hours a week\n• Visualizing how workers' compensation services reduce claim denials by 30%\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nCould I sketch something out for you?

The software has many features that makes keeping track of employees' information quick and painless. This software is capable of handling much more. Absolute Technology offers other services with additional costs, such as direct deposit, pay garnishments, accessories for the electronic time clock. Payroll Problems If your company is like most, your payroll system is less than perfect(!) The average employer with hourly workers spends more time on payroll issues than any other single element of administration! Inaccurate time cards must be corrected Supervisors spend hours on schedule and attendance verification Data must be transferred to the payroll system Inaccurate paychecks generate unhappy employees Resolving employee disputes costs time, money and morale Now there is a system that eliminates the paperwork, that can be verified by supervisors in less than 10 minutes a day and works seamlessly all the way from the time clock to the completion of paychecks. If this sounds like a system you need right now, call us for more information at (541) 312-9041 , or go to our contact us page. Payroll Problems How it works Absolute Technology Payroll integrates the entire process, from the time clock to the paycheck. Our system that begins with an electronic time clock that is directly linked to the system software. Employees use a credit card-sized magnetic card to check in and out, similar to processing a credit card. The system compares the entry time to the employee s schedule for initial verification, and the information becomes available to multiple supervisor workstations. A security and password system allows grouping of employees by supervisor and administrator so that all levels are protected from unauthorized examination or modification. On a daily (or other) basis, a group supervisor can audit and modify clock punches and compare them to each employee s planned schedule. Confirming/editing a 15-30 person group takes less than ten minutes. On a weekly (or other) basis, a supervisor prints a group report that each employee can review for accuracy. When all employees are confirmed, the report can be batch transferred to payroll. The system prevents partial transfers, duplicate transfers, and transfer of information that is in dispute. On the pre-determined pay schedule, checks are cut, taxes withheld and management reports generated for delivery to the pay site. If this sounds like a system you need right now, call us for more information at (541) 312-9041 , or go to our contact us page. Payroll Problems Frequent Questions I have a manual system for 15 employees. Can the Absolute Technology Payroll system save me money? Usually it can, but 'apples to apples' comparisons are difficult. Many of the costs of manual systems are hidden, and it may look like your manual system is cheaper than it actually is. Such things as supervisor corrections, discussions of vacation time earned, and penalties for improper tax withholdings are a few of the items that can be overlooked. The best thing about the Absolute Technology system is that every element is integrated, so that the process is more likely to be smooth, and mistakes are easy to correct. A system that works saves more money every year that you have it. I already have an automated system. Why should I switch? If you are happy with your system, you shouldn't. However, some of the reasons we hear from our current customers are that they like the ease of reviewing time-clock information, that was something they weren't getting from their old system. Others tell us that they like the fact that we can deliver completed payroll checks and tax withholding reports, freeing their human resources department to do things that only they can do. In the end, it is simply a question of whether we can help you overcome problems that you might currently have. Do I need a new electronic time clock? In all likelihood, you do. It's the foundation for everything that follows, (you've heard of 'garbage in, garbage out'?) What if I need technical support? If you need it, you get it. We're selling headache relief, and support all our installed systems. Do you have a question that didn't get answered? Call us at (541) 312-9041 , or go to our contact us page. Payroll Problems System Demo Youtube Video A useful demo can be tailored to your specific situation. Give us a call at (541) 312-9041 to discuss your company and the way you currently track details like hours worked, vacation schedules, sick days, and authorized absences. Payroll Problems About Us Absolute Technology, Inc. grew from an exercise in addressing the challenges of a real company. When we realized that not even the largest payroll companies could solve our problems, we knew we would have to write our own software. With our background in computer programming, and a very real company payroll to streamline, we built an integrated system from the ground up. At each stage of development, we could see the results, talk to the supervisors about additional requirements, and in general, to optimize the entire system. When the project was complete, we thought we were done. However, the company president had other plans. \"As good as this thing works for us,\" he said, \"I think other companies would like it, too. Let's make a commercial version that's flexible enough to be tailored to other businesses.\" That's it, in a nutshell. Unlike companies that have technology, but don't really understand business, or some of the big payroll companies that are so invested in the old ways of doing things that they can't change their approach, we started with only one idea -- to solve the payroll problem. We might be able to solve yours, too. Give us a call at (541) 312-9041.

This means: It works with our system It has a track record for reliability It can be remotely controlled from your PC, which enables many of the \"nice to have\" features of our system. The clock itself features a remotely changeable welcome screen (\"Happy Birthday, Wanda!\"), and light, readout (\"punch accepted\") and buzz as confirmation. The time can also be remotely set to guarantee that the clock is in sync with the administrative system. Is this the kind of integrated system you need? Call us at",

How to get a derailed executive career back on track! - Devon James Associates, Inc. since 1992 Home The Book Purchase the Book Contact Us What Clients Say Executive Job Search Program \" from Bedlam to Boardroom ...How to get a derailed executive career back on track!\" by Colleen Aylward From Bedlam to Boardroom lets the reader in on the new ground rules for creating essential visibility, and offers a detailed road-map with helpful examples, timelines and insider tips for becoming a niche authority and getting in front of hiring managers. It is a rich resource that greatly increases the odds that an executive will be pursued as the targeted executive job candidate in today's market. And it is a how-to manual for adopting the essential new career-management practices necessary to maintain competitive advantage. FROM THE AUTHOR: After thousands of interviews in the 20 years of my retained recruiting practice, it is clear that Executive Job Seekers still rely on expert advice from the inside when faced with a recent or impending exit from a downsizing employer. And buying a book that empathizes with their situation, or points them to some immediate action plan is often their first step, especially when they can t afford the seminar that may tell them the same things. The 10 chapters in from Bedlam to Boardroom are filled with the competitive edge that I offer to these high level clients on a one-on-one basis. But it is evident that more and more executives are seeking this advice, after they have tried the traditional ways of job search and found them useless. Angst-filled executives come to me in desperation at the eleventh hour, with doubts about their current value, because they have never before had to look for a job. They wonder: \"What has happened?\" \"Am I no longer employable?\" \"Is this just a blip that will self-correct?\" \"When the economy comes roaring back, will the job search rules go back to what they once were?\" \"Will high-level generalists ever be back in demand?\" \"Am I still relevant? Viable?\" \"Will my next job come from my inner circle of business friends as usual, or is there some new game?\" After working together for a few hours, using the same practices that are now here in the book, my clients tell me, I wish I would have known this 6 months ago. And that critical knowledge boils down to this: The world is an online community now, and the future of your employment status is highly dependent on your ability to adapt. Moving forward in your career is all about digitizing your brand now: Positioning yourself on the global internet as an expert in something; Becoming an authority online; Solving particular problems in a particular niche and letting the world know that you did it and can do it again; Creating a virtual network of business connections as your audience and as your support infrastructure; And making sure that you are found. From Bedlam to Boardroom lets the reader in on the new ground rules for creating essential visibility, and offers a detailed roadmap with helpful examples, timelines and insider tips for becoming a niche authority and getting in front of hiring managers. It is a rich resource that greatly increases the odds that an executive will be pursued as the targeted executive job candidate in today's market. And it is a how-to manual for adopting the essential new career-management practices necessary to maintain competitive advantage.

Client Testimonials - Devon James Associates, Inc. since 1992 Home The Book Purchase the Book Contact Us What Clients Say Executive Job Search Program What Clients Say... Mike Andrews, VP Enterprise Sales \"Colleen has provided phenomenal expertise, insights and leadership as I have worked on my executive job search strategy and increased my personal web presence. While I've used the internet for years for research, I didn't connect it w/ \"career\" branding for others to find me in their executive candidate research. Far more than a LinkedIn guru, the scope of what Colleen teaches is much broader and will serve me for the rest of my career. She knows how to use the web for visibility, create a strategy for networking with the right people and on through to how to package your unique expertise and communicate effectively with recruiters and hiring managers along the way. Colleen has over 20 years in the executive recruiting business and has now become a leading Job Search Coach -- she knows how employers and recruiters work from inside the hiring machine. As a B2B Sales expert, I've always been a forward-thinker when it comes to using technology to create value. Thanks to Colleen's approach to online executive branding, I now understand how web software is increasing my personal value. I recommend Colleen without reservation. She is a first class professional who is super talented, works hard and delivers results.\" Trigg Villani, Business Development Executive \"As a senior sales executive in the technology sector, currently as a Sales Director for Oracle, I ve dealt with many executive coaches and executive recruiters over the years. None have morphed so effectively as Colleen Aylward from the world of retained recruiting to that of Executive Career Search Coach. This is why I ve referred her to close business associates on multiple occasions. Her expertise from 20+ years at the helm of Devon James Associates, plus her years spend on OUR side of the table (as a technology sales executive herself) make her the perfect coach for those who need to understand the landscape of today s executive recruiting world works, as well as, the extreme importance of executive online branding of yourself in today s information rich world. As driven executives in technology, none of us has had the time or inclination to work on social media or online branding or SEO of that brand. Colleen couples her easy going attitude with the inside knowledge how people search for executives, what they want to see, where they want to see it, and how to rank highly for those eyeballs. I have come to realize how important an executive brand is, and how critical it is to have ubiquitous social proof of one s niche expertise. Her book from Bedlam to Boardroom is an easy read and gives you the road map steps of marketing one s self your own brand and of ensuring that the right people find you when they need your expertise. Her passion about executive branding, her technical expertise in this area, and the fact that she can understand and pinpoint the unique skill sets of just about any executive these days, is a rare and wonderful combo in today s world of a million coaches \" Minkyung Lowe, Strategic Ecommerce Operations, Supply Chain Development \"As an Amazonian manager, I came to Colleen only because I thought I needed a few tips on researching possible next steps in the Seattle area. Because I had always been heads down in my career not out in the job market -- I was blown away about several things she showed me: No matter how great you are on paper, it s now all about social proof. Secondly, you cannot push yourself out to employers and recruiters these days UNLESS you have your solid brand out there on the web AND have social proof of your worth. And thirdly, it s not even about pushing yourself out to recruiters. It s about building your expertise brand as a magnet, so that employers and recruiters actually come to you are drawn to you in their searches -- instead of the other way around. In a few short months, with Colleen s coaching, I built a solid brand presence all over the web, and received two awesome high-level job ",

We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor One 4 All Accounting and Tax Corporation, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how business accounting organizes financials into one easy dashboard\n• Visualizing how payroll services automate employee onboarding in 5 minutes\n• Explaining how tax preparation uncovers hidden deductions for small businesses\n\nClients often tell us these pieces help reduce bloat, increase clarity, and lead to more meaningful conversions.\n\nI'd be more than happy to whip up a quick snippet; a short script or sketch; that speaks to what One 4 All Accounting and Tax Corporation does best. No commitments at all, just a chance to show you what's possible.\n\nIf you're open to chatting more, just hit reply. And if you're curious, there’s a site link in my signature with a few past examples.\n\nKeep doing what you do, it's making an impact.\n\nThanks again,\nTrent — Founder at Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

  "email 3": "Good day Haochen,\n\nJust following up again because I think animation could add real value to One 4 All Accounting and Tax Corporation’s messaging.\n\nIt’s an engaging way to capture attention and explain what makes your business stand out.\n\nIf it sounds useful, I’d be glad to prepare a quick teaser or script to show you what’s possible.\n\nYou can reply anytime, and a link to our portfolio is in my signature.\n\nWarmly,\nTrent — Founder @ Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nWhiteboard videos your customers will actually remember.",

She is ethical, knowledgeable, thorough, organized and gets the job done. She works well with our CPA to coordinate tax preparation as well. She cleaned up our books and payroll before the pandemic and then she guided us through the pandemic regarding PPP and grant applications and then the ERTC calculations.

We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Showing how tax prep uncovers hidden deductions for small business owners\n• Visualizing bookkeeping as accurate, stress-free financials in 30 days\n• Explaining how payroll services ensure compliance and avoid costly penalties\n\nClients often tell us these pieces help reduce bloat, increase clarity, and lead to more meaningful conversions.\n\nHow about a quick sample built around Adept Tax Services's strengths?

Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Visualizing how financial planning turns business owners' goals into achievable 3-year plans\n• Showing how QuickBooks setup and training saves small businesses 5 hours of accounting headaches per month\n• Explaining how tax planning reduces audit risk by 90% for Washington State individuals\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nIf you're open to a quick preview, I could whip up a ten-second mock or short script tailored to something core at Will Chen CPA; No pressure, no cost, purely exploratory.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring. In the meantime, you can view a few past projects via the link in my signature.\n\nThanks for leading with both heart and strategy.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",

  "web copy": "Wilson Jones Commissioning Prev Next WHAT WE DO Wilson Jones Commissioning WHAT WE DO Wilson Jones Commissioning has provided commissioning and retro commissioning services to building owners and general contractors for 19 years in the Puget Sound region. Our firm is a commissioning firm with 100 percent of our work dedicated to building commissioning. We specialize in the technically complex building market such as hospitals, laboratories and research facilities. Our Goal Our goal is to maximize the capabilities of the building we commission and its infrastructure systems to provide the best environment for the people working in those spaces. In order to achieve this, we ensure that those infrastructure systems are set up and tuned to be as energy efficient as possible and then we help the Owner in the transition from the Construction Team operating the facility to the Owner operating the facility. SERVICES Wilson Jones Commissioning Commissioning Services Wilson Jones Commissioning provides full-service commissioning services including design review, commissioning plan development, OPR, development of Basis of Design documentation and systems manuals, writing/review of commissioning specifications, development of controls startup plans and oversight, development of equipment startup plans and oversight, development and execution of Functional Performance Tests (FPTs), Test and Balancing (TAB) verification and oversight, commissioning schedule coordination with General Contractor, Owner training oversight, O&M documentation review, and post occupancy review and follow up. We can provide either Commissioning Agent services, hired by the Owner as a direct representative, or Test Engineering services, directing and performing testing under the scope of the General Contractor. Benefits As Mechanical, Electrical, and Life Safety systems become more complex, some Owners have found themselves with systems that do not function to meet their needs; problems with control systems, maintenance access, long shake-down periods, inadequate documentation, and high operating costs are just a few of the problems encountered. Commissioning helps ensure that these building systems are functional and maintainable. The Design team also benefits by helping define, within the contract documents, Contractor participation and deliverables required for successful start-up/testing, and by early identification of problems through design review. The Contractor team benefits through a systematic approach to quality assurance with the goal of obtaining final Certificate of Occupancy within the construction schedule. Code Requirements Many utilities and building organizations have provided incentives for commissioning as reports of monetary savings, energy savings, and Owner satisfaction due to commissioning have been published. In addition, some code jurisdictions are beginning to require commissioning of energy-related systems and equipment. The 2009 Washington State Energy Code requires commissioning of HVAC, lighting control, and domestic hot water systems, and issuance of the building Temporary Certificate of Occupancy is contingent upon the submittal of the preliminary draft Final Commissioning Report. Utility incentives, such as Puget Sound Energy s New Construction Commissioning Grant , offer reward for additional energy-related commissioning activities, such as building envelope testing and energy sub-metering verification. Our commissioning activities also count toward the U.S. Green Building Council LEED rating system, providing recognition of sustainable construction aspects of a construction project. All projects attempting LEED certification must fulfill the requirements of LEED BD+C v4. Budgeting Budgeting for either Commissioning Agent or Test Engineer services varies based on the complexity and size of the project, and the scope of commissioning services desired. Industry-published costs for commissioning range between 2% to 5% of Mechanical construction cost and 1% to 3% of Electrical construction cost. Historically, our fees range between 1% to 3% of Mechanical cost and 0.5% to 1.5% of Electrical cost.

We are also active in the U. S. Federal Government's System for Award Management (SAM). Wilson Jones Commissioning is an active member in the Building Commissioning Association (BCA), US Green Building Council (USGBC) and is an authorized Energy Star Service Provider. OUR APPROACH Wilson Jones Commissioning Our Approach To help prolong the life of building systems and to create the best environment for the occupant, we provide quality assurance to uncover deficiencies in design, construction, installation, programming and operation with our thorough approach. Thorough Design reviews We conduct very rigorous review of design documentation, including the full MEP set and architectural components that may have an effect on the MEP design. Owners, Ed Jones and Cindy Wilson, both have MEP design backgrounds which gives us great insight into the \"why's\" and \"how's\" of MEP design concepts. We put a lot of emphasis on the design review process because it is least costly to fix something during the design process and more costly to fix something the further along it gets in construction. Startup We witness all startup of equipment that includes integral controls to ensure the equipment is set up properly to work within the bigger system that is being installed. Functional Performance Testing We do comprehensive equipment testing with batch testing, testing every piece of equipment, but concentrating on the aspects that have the most direct impact on the people who use the space. This is more cost effective and we have discovered that this increases occupant and owner satisfaction. Training We take a very active part in the training process. We put together a training plan, including a calendar, training session agendas, and work with the contractors and vendors to get appropriate instructors. technical expertise and troubleshooting One of our strengths as a company is our ability to help troubleshoot. With our backgrounds in design, TAB, controls and our experience in this business, we've developed a thorough understanding of the equipment and controls so we can successfully solve issues and offer solid advice.

Cindy Wilson is very organized, prompt, and has a way about getting to the crux of a problem and then offering solid advice. I have been working with Wilson Jones for almost a decade and they have consistently exceeded our expectations. Scott Osterhage, Project Manager, Seattle Children's Hospital Their commissioning products and knowledge are outstanding. They work efficiently with both the owner s representatives and the contractors to coordinate commissioning & training activities. Their thorough understanding of the equipment and controls was instrumental in finding and resolving issues. Brian Rich, Project Engineer, Berschauer Philips Construction Company They developed and maintained good working relationships with the entire construction group. They worked effectively with each stakeholder - Owner, Occupant, Contractor, Architect/Engineer - facilitating a practical understanding of the equipment and control systems. Their communication and reporting was clear and concise. When issues or problems arose, they acted quickly to define the problem, research solutions and then verify solution implementation. Wilson Jones schedule coordination was top-notch. Alwa",

  "email 1": "Hi Cynthia,\n\nI came across Wilson Jones Commissioning recently and wanted to reach out directly.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We make whiteboard videos that break down complex ideas with simple, hand-drawn visuals. It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think Wilson Jones Commissioning could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Explaining how building commissioning ensures 99.9% uptime for critical systems\n• Visualizing how optimized HVAC systems reduce carbon footprint by 15%\n• Showing how commissioning retrofits cut energy waste by 20% in 6 months\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nI’d love to put together a quick concept; maybe a script or a short teaser; around one of your key offerings. No strings, just a preview of what's possible with Wilson Jones Commissioning's voice behind it.\n\nReply anytime if you'd like to talk more about this. There’s also a link below with some samples of what we’ve done before.\n\nKeep doing what you do, it's making an impact.\n\nRegards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",
  "email 2": "Hello there Cynthia,\n\nJust circling back. I realize it can be tricky to see how something like whiteboard animation fits into a business like Wilson Jones Commissioning, which is why I’d love to show rather than tell.\n\nIf you’d be open to a 10-second snippet or a short script tailored to one of your core offerings, I’d be glad to share.\n\nIt’s no obligation, just a way to explore what this could look like in your context.\n\nYou’ll find some of our past work linked in my signature.\n\nWarm regards,\nTrent — Founder @ Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",
  "email 3": "Hello Cynthia,\n\nJust circling back in case the timing makes more sense now. I still believe whiteboard animation could support something Wilson Jones Commissioning is working on, whether that is a pitch, process, or product.\n\nIf you would like to test the waters, I am happy to sketch something out to show what it might look like.\n\nYou will find past examples linked in my signature. Feel free to reply if you would like to explore this.\n\nWith appreciation,\nTrent — Founder @ Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nWhiteboard videos your customers will actually remember.",

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think Sound Planning Meetings & Events could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Visualizing your event's entire timeline in 60 seconds\n• Explaining how logistics experts save event planners 20 hours of prep time\n• Showing how virtual event tech boosts attendee engagement by 30%\n\nClients often tell us these pieces help reduce bloat, increase clarity, and lead to more meaningful conversions.\n\nIf you're curious, I could draft a ten-second teaser or sketch based on what Sound Planning Meetings & Events offers. Nothing formal. Just something you can react to, no strings or expectations.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to take this further. You can check out some of our work through the link in my signature as well.\n\nKeep doing what you do, it's making an impact.\n\nWarmly,\nTrent — Founder @ Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nWhiteboard videos your customers will actually remember.",

I have known Peter Loos since 1995. I highly value his overall ability to deliver solutions to the extent that when we no longer worked for the same organization, I retained his company Seabeck Systems as an outside consultant to build the Distributor Sales Reporting database for Dux Dental / Vettec Inc. They are thorough and detailed in their approach, but can still see the big picture objective. Seabeck Systems seems internally motivated to drive and succeed in every endeavor they undertake. Dale Akita Chief Financial Officer / DUX Industries Inc. Unfortunately, this is all too common, says Peter Loos. We almost always find the same root causes. Recently a client was referred to Seabeck Systems for an IoT strategy assessment. They had spent years hiring different vendors to launch their IoT program with limited success. Unfortunately, this is all too common, says Peter Loos. We almost always find the same root causes failure to form a business-driven strategy, a stubborn refusal to document business requirements, under-skilled and over-worked staff, and a shoestring budget. Seabeck Systems assessed and summarized the learnings of their IoT efforts. We identified underlying challenges, and outlined a roadmap to help their team avoid future pitfalls. We focus on prioritizing the issues, getting the right people from the business involved from the start, forming realistic estimates, and identifying what steps the team can take for themselves to save costs.

While she s spent the majority of her career in public accounting, Stephanie has also worked on the inside of both small and large businesses. From handling the books of a small produce market to working in the accounting department of a large construction company, she understands the day-to-day demands clients face. Stephanie s focus over the past 10 years has been to develop an advisory practice in her firm. In 2009, Stephanie was one of 10 CPAs in the US and Canada accepted into a Master Advisor program. This intensive 2-year program provided advisors with a focused perspective on helping clients identify and solve problems to reach their goals as well as talk about current client needs and how CPAs could better address them.

You re thrust into a crash course you never hoped to take! Our team will help you consider your options and develop a strategy that encompasses your personal and family needs, now and in the future. We offer our clients personal, scalable services, for less than one-quarter of most attorney billing rates. With our experience, you will be empowered with knowledge, understand your case and the divorce process , and how to advocate for yourself. Frequently Asked Questions Why should I work with you? At DSNW we understand that divorce is about people and families. Divorce is about your emotions, your wants and needs, and in many ways will define your future for years to come. There is far more to a successful divorce than working with an attorney. Our team approaches to divorce in a holistic way we are compassionate partners to help educate you through the process of divorce. Individual: If you are considering or facing divorce and feel alone, scared, stuck, or unsure of how to proceed, we can provide you with strategic guidance + compassionate support. Couple: If you want to work cooperatively with a team of experts, we can help. You can find more information on our services options HERE . Are you an attorney? We are a team of divorce experts who specialize in mediation, life and divorce coaching, parent coaching, client advocacy and financial aspects of your dissolution case. Can I work with the DSNW team instead of hiring an attorney? For individuals in high-conflict situations, an attorney is essential to provide the legal support required for a contentious case. However, working with our team can minimize attorney hours by helping you work more efficiently and effectively with your legal team. Our work with couples in our Conscious Uncoupling package reduces attorney time and legal fees even more. When working with couples, our team handles the preparation, negotiation and drafting of all the legal documentation necessary for your divorce. We partner with local attorneys for expert review prior to legal filing of all case documentation. Are you therapists? Many of our clients come to DSNW via a recommendation from their therapist. Our service is a great option between personal therapy, marital counseling and hiring a divorce attorney. We do not provide therapy; we provide divorce coaching services to help clients understand what they want and need, during their divorce and beyond. We often refer clients to talented therapists (in a variety of modalities + specialties), to do the intense emotional work that is often required during a divorce. Who does DSNW work with? We work with both individuals and couples who are either considering divorce or ready to proceed with the divorce process. For couples, we offer our Conscious Uncoupling package which focuses on coaching + mediation services. For individuals, we offer our Breaking Free package which includes coaching, strategy development and legal document drafting services. Why should I hire DSNW and not an attorney? Most clients find it advantageous to speak with our team prior to hiring an attorney. We do not replace a divorce attorney; we minimize their time and augment their expertise with our focused support + preparation. Family Law attorneys are experts at Family Law. While attorneys are experts at interpreting and applying the law to your case, most are not well-equipped to provide emotional support and detailed guidance needed as families impart major changes. Because we bill at a lower hourly rate, our prep work helps clients come into the attorney process more organized and well-prepared, with much of the homework done in advance. Couples who choose to work within our guided mediation process minimize their attorney time to only a few hours for final legal review. Our goal is to keep our clients and their families away from Family Court. This means you and your spouse are making decisions for your family, not the state (court), and not dueling attorneys. Our team works with you to educate both parties and confidentially bring your case to private resolution. What if I m already working with an attorney? We can work with you on an hourly basis to provide you with coaching and strategy development. Our Strategy on Demand service works alongside your attorney to provide extra guidance and support as needed. See Our Services for more information about what is provided with Strategy on Demand. What exactly will you do for me? Our process of support is similar when working with individuals and with couples. We start with an extensive introductory meeting with each client individually, to clearly understand their priorities, goals, concerns and identify any potential obsta",

I really appreciate you helping me out. You re the best attorney ever! D. I appreciate your help, understanding and aggressive efforts on my behalf. E. T. I have hired Lennard numerous times over years to handle my cases, ranging from class B felonies to gross misdemeanors. I was looking at 6-9 years of incarceration and Lennard has gotten two of my biggest cases dismissed and others reduced to practically nothing. Every time I consulted with him, he is extremely knowledgeable, tactical, honest, caring, and straight forward. And we have been in 4 different Courthouses around State of Washington, and in every Courthouse, he is very well-known with the judges, prosecutors, and staffs, which re-insured me that I was in very good hands. I m confidently able to recommend him to my closest friends and family who are dealing with legal issues, because I know they are going to be represented by the best. Lennard has basically helped me to receive another chance in life to start over and has helped me to learn from my mistakes and move on to being a better person. There are no any other lawyers like him. J. K. The best attorney on earth! J. S. G. You all are very professional and effective operation and I appreciate everything you done for me. Your staff, they are simply the best. C. S. Your staff has treated me with great respect and kindness. You are very blessed to have such a wonderful group of people working for you. They have always been very helpful and pleasant to talk with. P. J. C. I live on the other side of the country and had a case come up in his location. Well I came across the best. Started everything off from the first day, kept in contact with me every few days, and then day to day as the case came closer. He handled it VERY professionally with outstanding knowledge of the law. He helped me with everything I needed to do in defense of myself. He helped me retain my civil liberties from false accusations. I wish I didn t need him, but so glad I had him. J. S. I really do appreciate your help. The courtesy that I received from your staff I will never forget. The professionalism in the court room was very comforting even though the process is lengthy and the charge was minor. My case was handled by the firm with the utmost care. Thank you! T. P. Lennard was recommended to me from a good friend. This was a first time offense in my 55 yrs. I was embarrassed and humiliated to have to go through this ever. Lennard s Professionalism, Experience, Sensitivity and Respect to a client s needs was exceptional. His staff was professional as well and relayed my messages to him when he was unavailable due to his busy schedule of helping another client. Lennard always got back to me via phone or email, depending on the questions I had. His presence in the court room definitely showed that he had respect from his peers and superiors. I would highly recommend The Nahajski Firm. E. A Thanks for bringing our son s case to a very successful conclusion. You and your staff were very professional and helpful. T. M. I would like to sincerely thank you for all of the effort you put towards my case. I was very impressed with the professional manner in which I was represented and the profuse knowledge held by the partners of your firm. I consider myself very lucky to have found you. While I hope to avoid requiring your services in the future, I did very much enjoy meeting and working with you. Thank you very much. M. A. M. I do not recall a moment in my life that made me as astoundingly happy as those few words uttered from the judge s mouth on my court appearance. I want to thank you and your partners for the work you did for me again. Hopefully, I will not be asking for them again, but if need be, I know now who to call. I say that not because of the results, but because of the tremendous amount of concern, humanity (the dog was a nice touch), integrity and professionalism displayed by all in your firm in your dealings with me. D. W. M. I spoke with Rayne Nelson, the information that I was given over the phone and all the answers to all of my questions that I had at the time was extremely remarkable. I felt that all of the attorneys had more knowledge and experience in criminal law than any of the other attorneys that I had spoken with. Your office was ready to give me a free person-to-person consultation needless to say: the search was over for an attorney. A big heart-felt THANK YOU VERY MUCH. R. R. Just want to let you know how much we appreciate you taking the time to help us out! Whenever we need your help it is a time of high stress for our family and you always take away a lot of the anxiety with your friendly, efficient manner and expert experience. Thank you! L.A. On behalf of me, Mike and Eli we d like to thank-you for doing such a fine job of representing Eli. It meant a great deal to us and you always kept us informed and we always felt we were in good hands. Thanks again! L.S. I am writing to express my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to you and to Rayne for your excellent work achieving such a positive outcome in my defense against the State of Washington. Success in this matter did not appear to me to be in the least bit a foregone conclusion, and I believe that without your legal expertise and personal dedication to my cause I would be in a far more unpleasant situation today. Rayne was indeed brilliant at the pre-trial and your strategy and research prior to that day was obviously flawless. I am extremely grateful for this second chance that your work has secured me. Please thank the members of your office staff on my behalf for their professionalism and competency during my frequent communications with them. Their efficiency and assurance was much appreciated. G.R.F. He won my case, and I now have no criminal history nor did I go to prison, so I m very glad with the outcome. I ll make sure I don t make any mistakes, however if I ever did need a criminal defense lawyer, I would hire Lennard all over again. R.Y. Mr. Nahajski handled my case quickly and efficiently. He is not only extremely competent attorney but he actually made the entire ordeal go smoothly and alleviated my stress and concern. I truly felt that he was proactive in his approach instead of just getting to my case when he had to as so many other attorneys do. C.J. Our case was very complicated. It not only had Criminal but also Immigration consequences. We are glad that we chose Len to handle our case. He is the best criminal lawyer one can find. He is very knowledgeable and I strongly recommend that you talk to Len if you are looking for a good lawyer to represent your case. J.S. When I think back to it, it occurs to me that I was very fortunate to have found you as an attorney. You are not only an excellent attorney, but you are also a good man. I m not sure how common that is in your field, but I suspect not all that common. G.S. Very competent and trustworthy. Knows his business. . . . This was a whole new experience for me. With Lennard s help, the case was dismissed. D.S. Mr. Nahajski was hired as my lawyer three times. A DUI case, suspended license case, and another DUI, assault, drug and harassment case. The possible ramifications for my actions included prison time and a felony that would follow me the rest of my life. Lennard got me the best possible outcome for all of my cases. No jail time. He is professional, non-judgmental, extremely educated, and highly respected among his peers and the criminal justice system. A.S. Len was such a pleasure to work with. He was patient and explained all of my options and answered all of my questions along the way. He came up with a great strategy for my case and was there every step of the way until we had the best resolution possible. Case dismissed! I hope I never need a lawyer again but if I do, I know who to call. L.N. I am so happy that Len represented me. He worked tirelessly, kept me in the loop at all times, and was amazing in court. He had both short-term and long-term strategies and got my case dismissed by using his thorough understanding of the law. He was professional and personable, and I d recommend him to anyone. K.S. If you need a lawyer call Len Nahajski. Case dismissed. F.G. WE ARE HERE TO PROVIDE LEGAL HELP The Nahajski Firm was established in 1996 by partners Lennard A. Nahajski and Rayne J. Nelson with the primary goal of providing aggressive, effective and discreet representation to those facing criminal prosecution.

Nicole thrives on the challenges and complexities inherent in this area of law, and she is dedicated to providing her clients with the highest level of service and advocacy. Nicole's commitment to the legal profession extends beyond her practice.

Presentation Education: Seattle University School of Law, Bar Admission: Washington Central Washington University: Bachelor of Science in Political Science Bachelor of Arts in Sociology Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies Salish Elder Law Elder Law & Estate Planning 0 Peggy received her JD from Northeastern University in Boston in 1988. Her undergraduate degree is in Political Science from the University of Maine, Portland. After graduating from law school she clerked for the Hon. Robert Klein of Honolulu. She worked for a brief time at a personal injury litigation law firm in Honolulu. (She didn t like it.) Then Peggy moved to Washington, DC, and went to work as a legislative analyst for the Hon. George Mitchell when he was Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate. She dealt with critical issues affecting the State of Maine, especially fisheries. After Senator Mitchell retired, Peggy fell in love with Washington. She started over here with a career in local legislation, working primarily as a legal analyst for King County and for Snohomish County. Two major events in her life caused Peggy to change course and dedicate herself to Elder Law. The first was when her mother in Maine succumbed to dementia after suffering the disease for 5 years. The second was when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer, and spent a year undergoing difficult treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. From these experiences, Peggy developed a deep empathy and understanding of the profound physical, emotional and financial effects chronic and debilitating disease can have on her clients. Her conviction grew that people in their later years need and deserve topnotch legal services to protect their assets, provide for their increasing needs, preserve their independence, protect them from exploitation and provide for assistance when independent living is no longer safe or appropriate. Peggy is the past President of the Washington Academy of Elder Law Attorneys and is their 2017 Attorney of the Year. She is also a long-time member of the Edmonds Chamber of Commerce. Peggy L.

Marcia and John K Los Angeles, CA Tax Problems that We Solve IRS Back Tax Returns If you are facing back tax issues , the most important thing you can do is to become compliant again with the IRS. Usually this means going back and filing all of the back tax returns that you didn t do in years past, but there are a few things that can make this much faster and easier. We can save you a TON when it comes to claiming deductions and making sure everything lines up correctly, so give us a call today to see how we can help you. More About IRS Back Tax Returns Bank Levy One step further than a tax lien is for the bank to actually place a levy on your property , and physically take it to pay back what you owe. This is legal thievery on the part of the government, and can be placed on your home, cars, boats, property, etc.! If you have had a notice of an impending levy on your property, then you need to act quickly to have that removed before the government will come and take possession of your hard-earned property! More About Bank Levy Tax Lien One of the more impactful steps that the federal government can take against you is to put a tax lien on your property. This basically means that they take legal ownership of the property until all debts can be paid off on it. You won t be able to sell, refinance, or don t actually legally own until you can repay everything you owe plus interest. We can get these liens removed and amounts reduced quickly for you. Call us now to find out how.

Most important, you have to know both what you're looking at and what you're looking for you can't waste a client's time with a lot of rookie questions. Our goal is to be better, not bigger. We believe that the person doing the dirty work has to be the same person who knows the law and theory, not some junior associate. At Madison Cooke, there is no back room- what you see is what you get. Madison Cooke began business in 1988. From the beginning our services have focused solely on state and local tax specifically: sales, use, business and occupation (B&O), and personal property taxes. Those multi-state services include State and Local Tax Review (also known as Reverse Audit ), Audit Management, Consulting, and Compliance. More than 95% of the companies we reviewed were paying too much state and local tax resulting in millions of dollars of savings for our clients. Those savings are the result of helping our clients better understand and manage their state and local tax obligations. We're Good With Numbers 30 95% $Millions $$$ Years of Proven Track Record Clients Overpaying Taxes Saved for our Clients No Savings , No Fee bottom of page Services | madisoncooke top of page Our Services Taking your business to the next level At Madison Cooke, we take a comprehensive approach to provide a thorough and complete review and analysis.

Our experience, at many levels, in many industries, has beneficial cross-over that other firms can t match. In 95% of our reviews we have identified and successfully recovered tax dollars for our clients. Our services include Audit Management, State & Local Tax Planning and Administration, Consulting, and much more! Review Review ( Reverse Audit ) Madison Cooke will do a comprehensive review of your sales, use, B&O, & personal property tax. No guesswork, no wasted time, just results. Over 95% of the time we find that our client is paying too much state and local tax. Audit Defense Madison Cooke manages state and local tax audits. Our assistance ranges from complete audit management to behind the scenes review of an auditor's work. In either case it begins with a pre-audit review to assess your company's areas of exposure and opportunity. Consulting We obtain determination letters, conduct no-name negotiations, and research specific state and local tax issues. We structure transactions to minimize, defer, or eliminate state and local taxes. We facilitate proactive tax planning. Compliance For most of our personal property clients we file annual tax affidavits with county assessors. Our compliance clients pay less tax and are better able to manage and administer their personal property tax costs. We often provide assistance and training with other aspects of state and local tax compliance and administration. bottom of page FAQ | madisoncooke top of page FAQ Why have an independent state and local tax review? Every taxpayer can benefit from a fresh set of eyes periodically reviewing how state and local taxes are managed. A fresh perspective nearly always results in significant savings. Understanding ever changing state tax laws, agency practices and rulings are essential. But, it's only decades of practical experience in multiple states, jurisdictions and industries that allow our professionals to identify and implement proven tax-reducing strategies. Madison Cooke has a proven 30-year track record of creating substantial state and local tax savings for our clients. What sets Madison Cooke apart? Focus State and local tax isn't just our expertise it's all we do. Practical experience We bring decades of practical experience with state and local sales, use, B&O and personal property tax. Our practical experience involves auditing, accounting, finance, law, and tax administration. Our associates include former senior auditors of the Washington Department of Revenue in addition to former tax managers and tax administrators for manufacturing and high-tech companies. We've been in your shoes and understand your business and concerns from an insider's point of view. Comprehensive approach We don't focus on the low hanging fruit. All Madison Cooke's resources are applied to a thorough and complete review and analysis. Our experience, at many levels and in many industries, has beneficial cross-over effects that other firms can't match. Forensic analysis We are state and local tax detectives. Getting results requires both art and science. Consequently the professional associate who does the review and analysis has to be the same person who knows the law and theory, not a junior associate. Proven results In 95% of our reviews we have identified and successfully recovered tax dollars for our clients. Follow up Comprehensive training is provided after a successful review. We make sure you understand and implement the tax reduction strategies we identify. Value Our commitment is to deliver a service that is dramatically more valuable than the fee we earn. How much of the client's time is normally required? Madison Cooke's experience means we not only find more misplaced tax, it also means you and your staff will spend less time involved in the process. We start any review with a preliminary analysis. That analysis begins with a one-hour meeting to get acquainted with you and your staff and get a feel for your company's systems. After the meeting we spend an additional 2 to 4 hours (depending on the size and complexity of your company) independently reviewing the records we previously requested. When we are finished we go back to our office to continue our analysis. If the preliminary analysis indicates a reason to proceed we will communicate a plan for the completion of the review. If refund issues are discovered Madison Cooke handles all aspects of processing refund claims. That includes scheduling of refund claims, presentation of refund claims to vendors or governmental entities, managing of refund audits, refund negotiation, and any other actions necessary to ensure the refund is received. What types of issues typically arise in a review? No two reviews are exactly alike but there are common themes. Misunderstanding a particular credit, exemption or program: Research & Development in non-traditional high tech and non-high tech taxpayers In other words a client may have an engineering department whose activity falls under the statutory definition of Research & Development. R&D activity carries significant sales/use/B&O tax advantages. Availability and scope of tax deferrals Similarly, identifying eligibility for a deferral has significant tax advantages. Availability and scope of exemptions Similarly, identifying eligibility for an exemption has significant tax advantages. Misunderstanding key elements of the taxpayer's business: Tax decision makers and administrators often lack all the information necessary to classify the revenue stream correctly for B&O tax purposes. How the purchased item is to be used by the taxpayer is more important than the nature of the purchased item. Taxpayers typically look at what is being purchased to determine taxability. Additionally, the tax decision maker usually does not have the information necessary. Often the tax decision makers are not fully informed on what does and does not go into a particular product or how the product is produced. As a consequence items that are ingredients may wind up treated as supplies. Accounting systems are NOT built for excise tax: The use issue described above is often manifested in the accounting system. In other words, tax decisions are made by reference to taxable and non-taxable accounts which reflect the type of purchase rather than the intended use of a particular purpose. Simple errors in charging purchases to the wrong account can result in significant overpayments. For instance a common error is inventory purchases coded to a supplies account. Products and revenue accounts and classifications are often driven by other business issues (i.e. marketing or sales) and do not provide accurate information for excise tax reporting. DOR audits & advice: The DOR is required by statute and inclination to be conservative. Asking the DOR their opinion seldom results in an answer that gives the taxpayer the best result. Excise tax is fact based. The way a question is phrased and the word/terms used are critical in getting the best response. DOR audits, in theory, rely on statistical analysis. Taxpayers face two problems. First, they usually lack in house statistical expertise. Second, they are not aware of how the data provided for the audit can cause serious flaws in audit accuracy Garbage In, Garbage Out. Taxpayers don t have the knowledge or the contacts to resolve difficult issues without going to an administrative appeal. How successful is Madison Cooke? We recover better than 85% of claims filed on behalf of our clients. When engaged by a client to handle a DOR Audit (from the beginning) the client has always received a refund. When engaged by a client to review a DOR audit, on average, for every $1 assessed by the auditor, we obtained $3 of credits. In only two cases did the client owe the state tax and then it was less then $50,000. When engaged to follow another excise tax consultant we have always found at le",

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think Strategic Wealth Designers could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Explaining how legacy planning secures your family's future, beyond just a will\n• Visualizing your ideal retirement in 3 minutes, with a clear plan to get there\n• Showing how tax-mitigation planning saves $10,000+ in unnecessary taxes\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard.

Contact Zenith Tax Resolution, PLLC - Certified Public Accountant in Burien, Washington Tax Resolution Services Burien | Tax Relief, Tax Debt Assistance Tax Resolution Tax Relief | Tax Debt Assistance Here s How We Help You Get Tax Relief The IRS is a financial juggernaut that does not care about the people behind the financial struggles; the IRS simply wants their money, now! With our vast years of hands-on tax experience at Zenith Tax Resolution, PLLC, we help shield our clients from the overbearing government agency to help them overcome financial hurdles and stressful times. Most of this work takes place without you ever stepping foot in our offices. We have technology and resources here to support and represent you no matter where you reside. Of course, you can always come in person to our office if you prefer, whichever is more comfortable and convenient for you. Our Easy 3-Step Process for Tax Resolution: Worry Less, Less Worry At Zenith Tax Resolution, PLLC, we take each client through the following three simple steps, which always lead to a speedy resolution and relief! Step 1: Investigation Our meetings with clients are always confidential. Together, we will review your situation, recent notices, and discuss all available options for resolving your matter. We do this by submitting a power of attorney for immediate relief from the IRS contacts, analyze, and evaluate alternative settlement options. Step 2: Negotiation We stop collection proceedings and prepare & submit back tax returns for the years in question to the IRS. We will also draft paperwork for resolution plans and negotiate for a final resolution. Step 3: Resolution At Zenith Tax Resolution, PLLC, we are on your side! We will strive to obtain the best settlement possible under the current laws. We will request a penalty abatement, and your tax problem is successfully a thing of the past! Currently Not Collectible Offer in Compromise Installment Agreement Innocent Spouse Penalty Abatement Services We Provide to our Clients: Currently Not Collectible Let s be honest with the fact that life sometimes just gets in the way. For taxpayers who have no income, no job, and no assets, the currently not collectible pathway may be a resolution option for you. While placed in currently not collectible status, the IRS cannot enforce any collection actions and no payments must be made by the taxpayer despite any accrual of penalties and interest. Best of all, the tax debt is forgiven after 10 years. Offer in Compromise The Offer in Compromise resolution option is the government s Let s Make A Deal program that allows you to settle your entire tax debt including penalties and interest for less than you owe. The Offer in Compromise essentially wipes the slate clean, allowing the taxpayer to start fresh once again on the right foot. The IRS Code states: We will accept an Offer in Compromise when it is unlikely that we can collect the full amount owed and the amount you offer reasonably reflects the collection potential (Internal Revenue Code 7122). Installment Agreement The installment agreement resolution option is the government s payment plan option that allows the taxpayer easy and affordable monthly payments on your tax liability. The agreement keeps the IRS or the state from levying if the payments are paid as agreed. Without an installment agreement, the IRS or state may take all but a small amount of your paycheck. They can also levy bank accounts and file liens on all of your assets including your home. We may be able to combine an Installment Agreement with a Penalty Abatement to save money and get time to pay the rest. Innocent Spouse The innocent spouse option allows a spouse to be relieved from tax debts owed due to misdeeds or fraud committed by another spouse. This tax problem resolution is based on a two-part set of rules encompassing Innocent Spouse, Separation of Liability, and Equitable Relief. The appropriate portion of the solution depends on each taxpayer s situation. Considerations include whether the spouses are still together, whether there is an understatement or underpayment on the joint tax returns filed, and other factors that can affect mitigation. Penalty Abatement The IRS and state both increase the taxpayer s tax liability by pyramiding penalties and interest to the unpaid tax. In many cases, a taxpayer could pay the tax, but thanks to the penalties and interest, the ballooning balance quickly becomes unmanageable. Penalties and interest might be reduced or eliminated if you can demonstrate reason",

Call Now Button Medicare Resources - Sound Planning Group Skip to content Take the first step towards Simplifying 65 The closer you get to age 65, the more you should be thinking about your Medicare-related options and the necessary steps you need to take. Discover why understanding your Medicare options is vital to your health! We work closely with several of the top insurance carriers to create customized solutions that fit your needs not our bottom line. Whether you re a new Medicare beneficiary or a longtime Medicare Supplement owner, we re here to help you explore your plan options. As part of our commitment to creating you -focused strategies, we offer no-obligation supplemental insurance quotes and FREE educational courses ! Frequently Asked Questions Initial Election Period Expand If you re receiving SS, then you re automatically enrolled and will get your Medicare card in the mail 3 months before your 65th birthday or your 25th month of disability. In most cases, you will automatically get Part A and Part B starting the first day of the month you turn 65. However, if your birthday is on the first day of the month, your coverage will start the first day of the month prior. What does Medicare cover? Expand Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people ages 65+, as well as those younger than 65 with specific disabilities or medical conditions. The insurance has four coverage types, which range from inpatient hospital care to prescription drugs. However, Medicare doesn t cover all medical expenses or extended care, so you may need to consider additional insurance. Click here to schedule a call with a licensed Medicare agent. How much are premiums? Expand For most people, Part A coverage doesn t have a monthly premium, as long as you worked and paid Medicare taxes. Part B monthly premiums start at $170.10 (as of 2022) and go up based on your income. Premiums for Parts C and D vary by plan. Register for our Medicare 101 workshop here to learn more. When do I enroll? Expand Once you receive Social Security benefits or railroad retirement checks, the Social Security Administrations (SSA) sends you enrollment details a few months before your Medicare eligibility begins. From there, the SSA typically enrolls you automatically in both Parts A and B. If you re not getting Social Security or railroad retirement benefits, contact the SSA three months before you turn 65. Medicare Supplement vs. Advantage Plans Expand A Medicare Supplement (Medigap) policy is health insurance sold by private companies to fill in the gaps in Original Medicare. Advantage Plans include benefits at least as good as Original Medicare, but can include additional benefits not otherwise available through Parts A & B (including prescription drug coverage). For more, click here to register for an upcoming Medicare 101 workshop. Registration is free. What if I still have employer coverage? Expand If at age 65 you still have insurance through work, then you do not have to sign up for Medicare as long as your organization has 20 or more employees. If you choose to delay, you can enroll in Medicare, penalty free, once you retire or otherwise, lose your insurance. SPG contracts with multiple major carriers in the marketplace that they feel bring value to their Medicare planning process. SPG does not offer every plan in your area. Currently, they represent 8 organizations that offer 72 products in your area. Please contact medicare.gov, 1-800-MEDICARE, or your local State Health Insurance Program (SHIP) to get information on all of your options.

Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how customized financial plans help families retire 5 years earlier\n• Visualizing how tax planning saves $10,000 in unnecessary taxes\n• Explaining how healthcare planning ensures access to top medical care in retirement\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nI’d be glad to pull together a short demo; maybe a script or quick sketch; based on what Sound Tax Planning does best.

Whether navigating economic uncertainty, reimagining team structures, or responding to evolving funder expectations nonprofit leaders must inspire, adapt, and collaborate with purpose. The Hidden Costs of Outdated Accounting Systems in Nonprofits Nonprofits must consider the hidden costs of sticking with outdated accounting systems. By investing in modern software solutions, they can save time, reduce errors, and save money in the long run. Why Nonprofits Must Update Their HR Handbooks Every Year Nonprofit HR leaders juggle compliance, employee expectations, and evolving workplace norms. Yet one essential tool is often overlooked: the employee handbook. Without annual updates, even the most mission-driven organization risks legal exposure, internal confusion, and cultural misalignment.

Get Started Automotive Industry We designed, developed, and implemented a process to convert an engineer-focused Method of Manufacturing ( MOM ) to a shop floor-optimized MOM and reverse. This solution was designed to accommodate MOM revision after the start of production and with existing labor reporting. Savings include: 24 hours of reoccurring manual engineering reduced to approximately 54 seconds. Structural Manufacturing Our client manufactures-to-spec CAD-designed mezzanines for industrial centers (Amazon, Target, etc). We designed an integration to break down the CAD BOM into a list of shippable components on the Sales Order, then generated a list of tracked jobs for progressive shipment and onsite assembly. Approximately 440 detailer man-hours per week. Component Distribution High-volume shipments of visually similar components serving multiple industries caused our client to have an approximate 17% shipping error rate. By implementing an inventory control system through training, labeling, and process reinforcement, we reduced the shipping error rate to 2.5% in the first month, and it is now approximately .25%. 85% improvement in shipping accuracy in the first month with improved customer relations. Between 10k-15k dollars in corrective shipping charges monthly.

Mason Our clients are a diverse group that come to us with a wide range of problems we help them solve. Below are just a sampling of the situations we've provided solutions for, actions taken and results achieved. INCREASED FUNDING Situation: A social enterprise focused on recruiting and retaining teachers of color did not have a robust strategic plan with clear goals, metrics and actions. This critical gap negatively impacted outcomes and funding. Action taken: We worked with the client to identify their key focus areas and core processes. We also developed goals, objectives, metrics, and actions. The new strategic plan was overhauled to drive results. Result: The client's new two-year strategic plan enabled them to secure multiple six figure grants and additional funding through the RFP process. SCHEDULE YOUR SESSION TODAY! PRIORITIZATION IS KEY Situation: A program provider for urban youth treated most tasks with equal priority, resulting in a staff that was stretched and stressed out. Action taken: The Optimist strategist worked with the client to create customized tools for project tracking and process mapping for the client s major programs. The strategist also created tools for managing unexpected stakeholder project requests. Result: The staff can now track program milestones and better prioritize their work. The tools used have improved communication within the organization and communication with community stakeholders, as well as reduced the stress felt by the staff members. INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY & EFFICIENCY Situation: The project management firm's procurement process was taking far too long. Once an agreement was reached with a new client, it was taking the organization a long time to complete and sign the contract. Action: The Optimist strategist worked with the client s team to map out the contracting process. This allowed the team to identify opportunities to eliminate unnecessary steps and to execute other steps in parallel. The future-state map created by Optimist for the client revealed an opportunity to go from a 49% process efficiency to a 77% process efficiency. Result: The Client is already seeing the benefits of a more efficient formal process for completing and approving contracts. 40% INCREASE IN CLOSURE RATE = SATISFIED CLIENTS Situation: This woman-owned marketing firm has recently experienced a significant decline in its client closure rate (the finalizing of a contract after proposal submission), and they didn t know why. Action: The Optimist strategist worked with the firm s leadership team to apply six sigma strategies for obtaining customer feedback and identifying root causes for the decline. Result: The firm responded to the customer feedback by adding another touchpoint to the contract closing process to hear and address client concerns. The client closure rate increased by 40%. OVERWHELMED WITH DATA Situation: The leader of an educational institution was overwhelmed with data. With 1000+ data points, a plan was needed for data analysis and an action plan was needed to address themes. The institution's limited capacity and competing priorities were prohibitive",

They literally saved my financial life, our home and family. I had a major issue facing a short sale of a property due to fraud issues and already owed over $100K in back taxes to the IRS. Within a day of reviewing my old tax returns they found several mistakes my CPA had made that cost me tens of thousands of dollars. They helped me refile those taxes and my current taxes to wipe over 75% of my tax obligation to the IRS, which resulted in a huge refund from my state taxes.

I was well over $80,000 in debt and did not know where to turn. I worked with a different tax relief and after 3 years with no results I decided to try a different company. T&T Tax Relief got me compromises for both debts in under 6 months. I would recommend this services to anyone who is in need of professional help. Mr. Donald Albert Rebecca & Patrick Olsen My husband and I were in serious trouble and we did not see any way out. We were to the point where we were going to file bankruptcy because of our tax debt. We found Toledo & Toledo Tax Relief and learned about the services they could provide. As soon as we signed up, we were protected! The notices stopped coming in and the IRS informed us of the pending settlement with 4 weeks after signing up. To our surprise they were able to settle our $20,000 debt for $100. Curtis & Wendy Smith My problem started when I retired with my wife. I was under the assumption that taxes were being withheld from my retirement distributions but they were not. I let a few years go by and did not file my taxes. Well into our retirement we started to receive notices from the IRS, notifying that they had filed on my behalf and I owed them large sums of money. I had no way to pay what they were asking for. The IRS started to levy my Social Security benefits and we started falling behind on all our bills. After contacting these guys they made sure I was take care of. The following month's Social Security benefit was for the full amount. They were able to reach an agreement with the IRS for far less than what I owed. Thanks Toledo & Toledo Tax Relief! Michael Chepenick I started my own moving business but was too busy to keep up with my books and tax obligation and much less knew how to. Toledo & Toledo Tax Relief was able to explain how everything worked and got me started on a new path to running by business and staying current with my tax obligations. These guys really helped me and I would recommend them to everyone. * Client named changed to protect client's identity bottom of page Contact | United States | Toledo & Toledo Tax Relief top of page Contact Address 2372 Morse Ave Ste 349, Irvine, CA 92614 info@tttaxrelief.com Telephone (949) 954-0402 Send us a message bottom of page FILE TAXES ONLINE | TOLEDO & TOLEDO TAX top of page You Never Have to Visit a Tax Office Again! bottom of page Who We Are | United States | Toledo & Toledo Tax Relief top of page Who We Are Our Firm Our Tax Professionals have resolved tax issues for thousands of taxpayers using a wide variety of strategies to find a solution to your situation and keep you protected.

Paired with our income tax preparation services, we provide a comprehensive approach to preserving your wealth for the future. CONTACT US TODAY CONTACT US TODAY Estate, Trust, & Will Planning What is an Estate? All the property that a person owns is part of his or her estate. Your estate includes everything you own, less all of your liabilities. An estate can include a house, the land the house is built on, cash, bank accounts, retirement accounts, stocks, bonds, clothes, jewelry, tools, cars, musical instruments, and other items. What is Estate Planning? The American Bar Association defines Estate Planning as: A process involving the counsel of professional advisors who are familiar with your goals and concerns, your assets and how they are owned, and your family structure. It can involve the services of a variety of professionals, including your lawyer, accountant, financial planner, life insurance advisor, banker and broker. Estate planning covers the transfer of property at death as well as a variety of other personal matters that may or may not involve tax planning. The core document most often associated with this process is your will. Do I need an estate plan? Many people believe that estate planning is for those who are reaching the end of their life or only after death. This cannot be further from the truth. Estate planning really begins as soon as you have an estate. While they have good intentions, some people make terrible mistakes when proper planning is not done. Some of these mistakes include leaving all of their assets to their husband or wife, improperly titling real estate, not taking advantage of the gifting rules and allowances as provided by the IRS, and not naming the correct beneficiaries on their life insurance policy. The Basics One of the first things that you should do is define your goals and choose the various professionals to assist you in gathering the information and begin to put the plan together. Estate planning is not just about what happens after you die. A good estate plan will also protect you if you become incapable of handling your own affairs. A good estate plan will let you, not the courts, keep control of your assets and decisions about your medical care when you can no longer handle your own affairs. When do you begin estate planning? Most people need to plan out their estate at some point. The only time that you can prepare and implement an estate plan is while you are alive and you are capable of entering into a contract. There's no guarantee you'll have time down the road. What is a trust? A trust is an agreement between a person that owns certain assets and another person who will take care of or administer the assets (called a trustee). The trustee would take the position of its owner and make decisions on behalf of the owner. Should a trust be part of my estate planning? The drafting of the trust document is a very important function. It should completely cover your wishes regarding distribution of your property. The trust document may be used to protect your heirs by giving them rental or purchase rights to property. It can specify the price and terms of an asset purchase. It is important to formally transfer all assets to the trust. Most assets can be transferred into the trust without adverse tax consequences, but if you have some unusual assets, you should check out the tax effects. Why are trusts created? There are many types of trusts that a person could create, each designed for a specific purpose. Estate planning is a major reason for creating trusts. Avoiding probate is another major reason to create a trust. Trusts aren t just for the wealthy There are many reasons why on",

What We Do We Support Innovation Virtual Accounting Services Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Financial Controller Bookkeeper Virtual Accounting Services Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Financial Controller Bookkeeper Scroll Professional Virtual Bookkeeper | CFO Strategies LLC (855) 732-7861 Bookkeeper The scope of a bookkeeper, whether it is an in-person or a virtual bookkeeping position, can vary widely based on the client s needs and budget. For example, what works well for an insurance brokerage company may not be a good fit for an architectural firm. Bookkeeper Responsibilities Below are some tasks that may fall within a bookkeeper s duties. Recording invoices to be paid Making payments Generating and recording sales invoices Collections Making and recording deposits Administering and processing payroll Reconciling bank statements Creating and posting journal entries for all financial transactions Filing source documents Preparing financial reports , including cash flows Filing certain tax returns, such as payroll taxes and sales tax Bookkeeping services are provided on a schedule agreed to with the client and could be on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the client s needs. All services are customized and tailored to the needs of the clients. The most successful relationship is based on regular communication, where expectations are established and met or exceeded. Bookkeeping Benefits In today s workplace, most companies work in automated environments that facilitate or enable working remotely. As such, there is a greater demand for professionals that can work remotely or virtually. A virtual bookkeeper offers the same services and benefits you would expect from a bookkeeper working on-site. The virtual bookkeeper would obtain access to the company s systems, applications, and files remotely, perform the same tasks and deliver the same reports as when working on-site. The key to success is maintaining regular communication. Ultimately, there is no difference in the benefits a company will realize from the bookkeeper. By entering an independent contractor arrangement, employers reduce payroll taxes, insurance premiums, and other costs associated with having a full-time employee on the payroll. Many businesses need for a bookkeeper can be cyclical, so this arrangement can allow the business to ramp up the bookkeeper s workload during busy times and ease off during slower times. Further, it is common these days for staff to turn over frequently, often within 1-3 years, which is disruptive to an organization. Engaging an outside firm like CFO Strategies to handle your bookkeeping protects your company against staff turnover and the disruption and cost of starting over with a new bookkeeper. From the virtual bookkeeper s perspective, this structure can allow them to serve multiple companies anywhere in the country, giving them more knowledge of various systems and practices. Outsourcing your bookkeeping needs can provide a level of expertise that can otherwise be hard to get. Virtual bookkeeping firms and bookkeepers for hire often have quite a bit of experience in many different industries. Finding someone locally who can provide that level of expertise while staying within the client s payroll budget may be a challenge. Businesses don t need to provide office space, a laptop, or other supplies to the virtual bookkeeper. Virtual bookkeepers have flexible schedules as long as specific tasks are completed by the assigned deadline. Things to Consider Before Hiring A Bookkeeper Because virtual bookkeeping requires the bookkeeper to have remote access to your business s critical financial documents, data security is essential. It may be necessary to strengthen your network firewalls and other protections before you allow your virtual bookkeeper access to this sensitive information. You may also require the bookkeeper to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). This provides your organization with some protection against the disclosure of its private data. The average annual income for bookkeepers is approximately $60,000 . This can vary based on location, the volume and complexity of transactions, and the bookkeeper s experience. If this figure is well beyond your organization s budget, it may be worthwhile to look into ",

Overview About Flock Homes Compare & Contrast Flock's Portfolio Transaction Process Client Experience Overview What is Flock Homes? Founded in 2020, Flock Homes is a real estate company and fund operator empowering landlords to exit from their rental properties through the 721 exchange. Through Flock Homes, real estate investors can use the 721 exchange to exchange their single-family, duplex, triplex, or quadplex rental properties for ownership in Flock s fund without triggering capital gains taxes. While in Flock s fund, investors benefit from continued access to steady cash flow and residential real estate appreciation, without any responsibilities of managing rental properties. Where did the 721 exchange originate? 721 exchange refers to Section 721 of the US Internal Revenue Code, the same tax code that stipulates the commonly utilized Section 1031 (also known as the 1031 exchange). Section 721 was established in 1954 and has been used for decades by institutional investors to minimize taxes on real estate. Flock Homes has pioneered a platform that empowers individual landlords to access the same benefits of the 721 exchange. See our How It Works page for more details. Once I join Flock, do I still own my home? No. Once you join Flock, title of your homes is transferred over to the fund and you now own equity in Flock s diversified fund. As a result, you retain all of the benefits of real estate ownership, including access to cash flow and appreciation potential. However, you do not hold liability for managing any singular home. What kind of homes can I contribute to the Flock fund? Flock s fund accepts single-family, duplex, triplex, and fourplex rental homes. All rental homes that join Flock s fund must meet our financial return requirements. Homes with lower mortgage balances (generally, less than 50% of the home s value) are more likely to be accepted into the fund. To see if yours qualifies, click here to submit your rental home for an evaluation and our team will connect with you to discuss your valuation. How do I earn as a client of Flock s fund? With your ownership in Flock s fund, you have the ability to access cash flow from the rental income collected from the fund's portfolio of homes, and you continue benefitting from potential real estate appreciation based on the price performance of the homes in Flock's fund. You also transition into a fully passive approach to real estate investing, which has given Flock clients back countless hours of time and invaluable peace of mind. All operations of the homes in Flock s fund, including leasing, repairs, and even HOA payments are fully managed by our team of professionals. How does Flock help me minimize my taxes? The 721 exchange allows you to defer substantial capital gains and depreciation recapture taxes you might otherwise trigger in a traditional sale of property. Following the minimum hold period, you can also access greater cash flow quarterly and better control your tax liability by liquidating Flock equity over time. Finally, Flock equity also benefits from a step-up in tax basis upon inheritance ( read this for a detailed explanation on the step-up in basis ), which can provide your heirs significant tax savings when they choose to liquidate their equity. We recommend you consult with your tax advisor, attorney, and/or the IRS website to understand how Flock can complement your personalized tax planning. About Flock Homes What is the relationship between Flock Homes and Flock s fund? Flock Homes is the General Partner of Flock s fund (Flock Homes OP LP). In other words, Flock Homes acts as the manager of the fund, which is collectively owned by all of the investors who have contributed homes to the fund. What experience does the Flock Homes team have? The Flock Homes team encompasses decades of investment and management experience from the largest real estate institutions in the world, including J.P. Morgan, State Street Global Advisors, and Progress Residential, and has used their expertise to help 150+ landlords retire from real estate through Flock Homes. Learn more about the team here . What happens if Flock Homes goes bankrupt? Flock Homes, our company and General Partner of the Fund, is an independent entity separate from the Flock Fund, which holds the high-quality, income-generating assets collectively owned by clients (or, Limited Partners). This structure ensures that the Fund can continue operating as long as a fund administrator is in place. In the unlikely event that Flock Homes goes bankrupt, and to future-proof client wealth, Flock has entered into an agreement with Roofstock, a leading single-family rental (SFR) platform that manages 25,000+ homes across 35+ markets, to act as a standby servicer to the Fund. While Roofstock is not formally responsible for management today and does not have any management authority, Flock s arrangement engages Roofstock to become versed in the Fund s operations and assets, including the Fund s tax-driven execution and administration of 721 Exchanges. In the event there is a need to transition management of the Fund from Flock, Roofstock will, subject to the requisite approvals, be in a position to seamlessly integrate into the role of Fund Manager. What is Flock s historical performance? Flock has met or exceeded its cash return target to investors every quarter since inception. You can see our most recent Quarterly Fact Sheet for detailed performance figures here. Is Flock registered with the SEC? Yes. While Flock's Fund is not currently subject to full SEC registration requirements due to an applicable exemption, Flock is nevertheless regulated by the SEC and subject to the rules for private fund advisors. Flock also files a Form D annually. You can find our filings on the SEC s website . Compare & Contrast What is the difference between the 721 exchange and the 1031 exchange? Many real estate investors utilize the 1031 exchange to sell their home for proceeds, and use those proceeds, tax-deferred, to purchase other investment real estate. With Flock Homes, investors can use the 721 exchange to seamlessly exchange their homes, tax-deferred, for direct ownership in Flock s managed real estate fund. With a 1031 exchange, investors commonly continue to",

Continue Reading Read Less Do What's Right We believe in honesty and integrity, stewardship and accountability to our clients, our staff, and the communities we serve. Solution-Oriented We help clients find objective, defensible solutions for transactions and financial arrangements involving the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute. Constant Learning We maintain deep expertise through ongoing education, research, and active involvement in healthcare trade organizations. People First We prioritize the human element in everything we do, acting with kindness, respect, and appreciation in our interactions. Compensation Valuation Services Compensation valuation assesses whether a healthcare provider's pay aligns with FMV and commercial reasonableness. This is often essential for compliance with laws such as the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute, which regulate financial relationships between providers and referral sources. Compensation valuation analyzes provider productivity data, regional benchmarks, and industry standards. It involves metrics like total work relative value units (wRVUs) for physicians, collections, and hours worked. For example, ensuring a physician s salary for a medical director role complies with FMV helps safeguard against legal risks and promotes ethical practices. Defensible Solutions for Evolving Compensation Models Aligning physicians and other healthcare providers is vital to the success of healthcare organizations. With an ever-changing regulatory landscape and constantly evolving compensation models, it is critical to support compensation arrangements with well-reasoned, defensible, and actionable fair market value (FMV) opinions. At Root Partners we don t provide canned opinions or survey-based calculators. Instead, we work diligently to understand our client s alignment goals, the regulatory guardrails pertinent to the arrangement, and the true market-based value drivers underpinning the compensation arrangement. Most importantly, we work collaboratively to educate all parties involved to build consensus and facilitate a successful and compliant outcome. Fair Market Value in Clinical Compensation In an ever-changing regulatory and competitive environment, clinical compensation models should be continually evaluated to remain attractive to providers, commercially reasonable, and compliant. Root Partners does not take a one-size-fits-all approach to clinical compensation. Instead, we consider both quantitative and qualitative measures that truly drive fair market value. Clinical compensation engagements include : Physician and APP employment Professional services agreements (PSAs) Subsidies and stipends Call coverage Medical directorships Administrative Compensation Strategic alignment across the healthcare continuum is a driving force behind improved outcomes and reductions in the cost of care. With the ongoing evolution of payor models, value based enterprises, healthcare technologies, and novel services models, the need for innovative and dynamic valuation models has never been greater. At Root Partners , we pride ourselves on being a solution-driven appraisal firm providing defensible and well-reasoned FMV opinions across an ever-changing landscape of administrative pay models. Examples include: Physician executive and administrative pay Pay for performance and value-based compensation Management services agreements (MSAs) Clinical co-management and hospital quality and efficiency programs (HQEP) Care coordination and management Healthcare technology platforms / novel care delivery models Compliance Testing and Appraisal Review: Ongoing Support and Validation Keeping your compensation models consistent with FMV is an ongoing process. Root Partners is here to help, with ongoing testing and review processes that can help your organization proactively monitor compensation. Our objective is to ensure compliance before a problem arises. If your organization has received a healthcare valuation that doesn t quite seem right, we are here to personally review all the information and critique previous work. We want you to have a clear understanding of our opinion on the appraisal and our suggestions for your next steps. We work with clients across the United States from California to Texas to Florida who need a sound valuation of their practice. We are credentialed members of the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) in Business Valuation and the National Association of Certified Valuators and Analysts (CVA) in Business Valuation.

Managing AI in the Workplace Our Members Include I attended the harassment prevention workshop put on by Employers Council, and I wanted to share my praise for the presenter. I was skeptical about whether I would learn anything I didn't already know, but she presented the information in thought-provoking and nuanced ways. She answered questions well and had us do an activity that enlivened the presentation. As an academic, I particularly appreciated the way that she was able to address the issues intellectually and not simply give us an \"information dump.\" Anyway, I was impressed with what I expected to be a boring presentation. - Professor, Regis University Professor - Regis University Our handbook needed to be updated. We had done minor revisions over the years, but more policies than we needed crept into the handbook over time. I wanted to keep what was important and get rid of the rest. I sent my handbook to Employers Council and staff went through all of the policies to first let me know what could be eliminated, and what needed to change in order to bring it up to date. The best thing was that this is part of my full membership dues, so there was no charge for this. I send in my handbook every one or two years for a tune up, so it reflects current laws and stays streamlined. Lynnette Siedschlaw, HR Director - Moffat County As I faced some difficult employee problems over the years, I knew that I could reach out to Employers Council and get some good solid advice in how to handle a situation. In the 20 years if have been working in HR I don t believe I was ever given bad advice. I may not have always agreed with what the counsel was, but I never put myself or the company in a compromising position by following your advice and recommendations. Joe Maylin, Human Resources Manager - Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. Being able to reach out to someone on the Member Experience Team when something comes up and we're just not sure how to handle it is amazing. We have help just a phone call or an email away, and everyone that we have worked with has been so responsive, understanding, and helpful.

People are the heartbeat of a healthy culture. If your culture is miss-aligned with your mission and values your organization is in trouble. You ve likely experienced a workplace that s chaotic and stressful, where employees are not excited to come to work. Either intentional or not culture is the beliefs and values that we encourage, support, or tolerate . It s not at all what we say, but what we do, how we act, and how we work or don t work together. If your workplace has spiraled into a stressful, unproductive space and retention has become a spillway, you ve just made the case for your Culture Reset. Request a Consultation Monthly Subscriptions We support our clients with the safety net of a HR department and peace of mind that their business is compliant with the latest regulations, and prepared for any employee issue big or small.

Your personalized employee handbook will cover the ever-changing state and federal laws, or not leave room for confusion and possible lawsuits? We will design a customized culture-first employee handbook that reflects the current HR realities and gives you a solid foundation that covers all the bases-and then some.

We believe in the interview process where we ask you questions and you answer and you can ask us questions and we answer. You should participate in the review of your tax return before filing in order for you to understand why you have a refund or why you owe tax. All tax returns are completed during your appointment and you will walk out with your tax return in hand. Types of tax returns we prepare: Individual Returns (including crypto and small businesses) Business Returns Payroll Forms at the federal level Sales Tax Forms State Returns Why is Crescere a better choice? 35+ years of total experience.

Yes (within reason of course). We take calls almost every day of the year. Hidden costs? None.

Learning Journey Maps FAQs How do Learning Journey Maps work? Learning Journey Maps are interactive tools designed to guide learners through a training program or course, providing them with a visual representation of their learning path. These maps help learners understand the overall structure and progression of the training, making it easier for them to navigate through the material and stay motivated. Here's how Learning Journey Maps typically work: Visual Representation: A Learning Journey Map presents the training program as a visual roadmap. It may be displayed as a linear timeline, a branching pathway, or any other format that best represents the learning progression. The map is usually divided into different stages or modules. Starting Point and Endpoint: The Learning Journey Map clearly indicates where learners begin their training and where they will ultimately reach at the end of the program. This provides learners with a sense of orientation and helps them set expectations about their learning journey. Milestones and Checkpoints: Along the learning path, t",

We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Explaining how personalized coaching improves tournament performance by 3 strokes\n• Visualizing how negotiation experts secure 20% more sponsorship deals\n• Showing how financial planning helps golfers save 5 years of retirement funds\n\nClients often tell us these pieces help reduce bloat, increase clarity, and lead to more meaningful conversions.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to share a quick demo built around something Sterling Sports Management offers. Just a sketch or script; no pressure, no pitch; just curious to see what it might sound like in your voice.\n\nIf you’re curious about what this might look like, just reach out. There’s a link in my signature with a few examples you can check out, too.\n\nThanks for leading with both heart and strategy.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Founder @ Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",
  "email 2": "Hi there Jeffrey,\n\nReaching out again in case the idea of using whiteboard animation is still on your radar.\n\nIt’s often a great fit for simplifying dense content, making internal updates more engaging, or curating educational content that feel less overwhelming and more human.\n\nFor Sterling Sports Management, I’d be glad to sketch a quick visual or draft a short script so you can see what this might look like in practice.\n\nReply when you can, or check out some examples in the signature below.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",
  "email 3": "Hey Jeffrey,\n\nCircling back once more before I close the loop.\n\nIf there is anything at Sterling Sports Management you have been meaning to simplify, such as those boring quarterly reports your team never reads, then whiteboard animation could help bring that to life.\n\nI would be happy to sketch something if you want to see what that might look like. You can reply anytime or check out some of our previous work on our website, linked in my signature.\n\nBest wishes,\nTrent — Founder @ Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nAnimation for experts who need to sound less 'expert-y'.",

Ahola HR Solutions | Payroll 4.1 Based on 154 reviews powered by G o o g l e Ashley Lawson 19:55 26 Feb 25 Over the past year, partnering with Ahola has been transformative for our Ohio-based small business. Their expert guidance has enabled us to introduce several new and enhanced benefits, significantly elevating our workplace culture to be more supportive and enriching for everyone. Special thanks to Tina and Kennedy for their direction, patience, and genuine care throughout our journey. Their dedication has been instrumental in fostering a better workplace for our team, which, in turn, has enhanced our competitiveness and productivity for our clients. Josh Androsac 17:52 16 Feb 25 A great family owned company that is there for the clients!! Dennis M. Flood 16:47 15 Jan 25 Deciding to go with Ahola Payroll services was one of the best decisions we have made. The level of service is top notch and having a dedicated representative that I can call is a huge asset. I highly recommend Ahola for any business, small or large. chris goebel 21:38 09 Oct 24 I have owned two companies, and both have used Ahola for their payroll. They have been great to work with for over 30 years Marsha Davis 15:31 06 Mar 24 I highly recommend Proactive HR Consulting Services. In two short months, they gave our HR Department the push it needed, and in the right direction. Our management team presented them with our wish list and one by one, they took them on; each time exceeding our expectations. Laurie always responded to all my questions in a timely manner with great suggestions and resources; so many resources that we were able to create a library of HR topics on how to navigate any HR issue we could think of. Always respectful of our time and eager to learn about our industry, she went above and beyond in helping us resolve current issues as well as pointing us in the direction of where we want to go. The flexibility this plan offers is key. The month-to-month agreement allowed us to press pause when our company needed to focus on other issues. It s great to know that we can return anytime and pick up where we left off. Like their parent company Ahola, we received the same great customer service, and attention to detail that we have come to depend on. Ken Weinberg 11:24 01 Feb 24 I have worked with many payroll companies in the past, but none can compare with Jake and Ahola. As a tax professional, I am approached constantly by payroll companies. The problem is they promise the world and offer low initial fees and great customer service, but this is only a sales pitch. Soon after the sale, they disappear. Customer service is lacking and your sales rep seems to change every year. Only with Jake and Ahola are you assured consistent prices and always the best customer service in the industry.. Because when you go with Ahola, you also get Jake and he will always go above and beyond to meet and exceed any expectations you might have. Cynthia May 19:43 11 Jan 24 We have used Ahola for several years and cannot be more pleased. We are a small family business and they have always seen that we are well taken care of. CJ handles my payroll processing, and he is outstanding. He is knowledgeable and helpful. Ahola truly cares about their customers. I highly recommend them for your payroll needs. Malavite Excavating, Inc. Terri Healey 10:58 28 Sep 23 Jake Krider and Ahola HR Solutions are dependable, responsive, and knowledgeable. They have provided excellent ideas for how we can streamline and improve our payroll processes. AND they provide a dedicated point of contact for your whole time with the company, not just during the sales and implementation process. Thank you! Cornerstone Managed Properties 14:26 04 May 23 Great company, great products, even better staff. Worked with several departments and people over the years and our experiences have all been great. Wont find a better payroll/hr company out there, than Ahola. Shannon Kuhrt 19:11 20 Apr 23 We have been a customer of Ahola for decades. Their family business offers personalized service always by a friendly and knowledgeable staff member. We have had the same contact for many years and she knows our unique business which makes it super easy and reduces stress whenever questions or issues arise. She is always quick to respond anytime we reach out. At Ahola, you are a not a number....they treat each of their clients like family. Janelle Kelly 19:17 13 Apr 23 I'm very impressed with Ahola's payroll processing platform. We are a small company, and they always take care of us no matter what the issue is. Everyone I've had the pleasure to speak with there is knowledgeable and helpful and makes our experience with them that much more impressive. -Universal Oil Inc Melanie Gawne 01:26 03 Nov 22 I had the pleasure of meeting with Jake, his kindness and knowledge was outstanding. Not only did he take time to explain his business but also gave me guidance on how I can improve my own business. Jake is a genuine person who is willing to go the extra mile to help you. Thank you Jake! Heather Olarte 04:29 17 Aug 22 Our company was very apprehensive with moving over to a new Payroll provider, however Ahola's Implementation Team was great through the whole process and made sure that even our specific situational needs were addressed and resolved to our satisfaction. Pegasus Papatonis 14:51 06 May 22 Absolutely love everything about this company!! Family owned and operated, very talented staff specifically the 2 ladies i work with Shellie and Sandy Way better than ADP, friendly attentive, and hands on. Tom Lamb 23:16 22 Sep 21 Excellent customer service. Always willing to help with all issues. Enjoy working with Sheila ! Tim Raleigh 16:16 15 Jun 21 I could not be more pleased with the service we have received from Ahola. Everyone I have had the pleasure to deal with has been extremely friendly and more importantly helpful and quick to get the job complete. I have been extremely impressed from the very beginning with Paula and then Stephanie, Russell, and Corinne. I'm not sure why other payroll companies can't give this kind of service, but I am glad I found Ahola. Customer for life. Susan George 13:59 20 May 21 I am new to Ahola - just implemented in January 2021 - and I am so pleased with this company. Running payroll is a breeze with Ahola! Must more efficient and user friendly than other software than I have used in the past. Sheila Hardy has been truly amazing to work with! I greatly appreciate her positivity and willingness to help in every situation. Couldn't ask for better service! When I have questions, she is always happy to answer them and gets back to me very quickly. I will certainly recommend Ahola to others in the business community! Fantastic job and fantastic people!

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think Payroll Management Assistance could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Explaining how tax management finds an average of $1,500 in missed deductions\n• Visualizing how HR management reduces employee turnover by 15%\n• Showing how payroll processing saves small businesses 5 hours a week\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nI could pull together a quick sketch or sample script based on one of Payroll Management Assistance’s core offerings.

View Surveys Great Colleges Program The Great Colleges to Work For program was designed to recognize colleges that have been successful in creating great workplaces and to further research and understand the factors, dynamics and influences that have the most impact on organizational culture in higher education. View Programs Who We Are - ModernThink Who We Are Our mission and passion are helping colleges and universities become better places to work and learn. Founded in 2004, ModernThink is a management consulting firm with particular expertise in workplace quality, organizational culture, and employee engagement. As a research and consulting leader in workplace quality, ModernThink has been involved with over 50 city, state and regional Best Places to Work initiatives. ModernThink has surveyed over 1,200 colleges and universities through the Great Colleges to Work For program and in our work with individual institutions and systems. We have a deep understanding of the challenges currently facing leaders in academe and substantial expertise providing data-driven solutions. Our mission and passion are helping colleges and universities become better places to work and learn. In partnership with The Chronicle of Higher Education, ModernThink co-founded The Great Colleges to Work For program in 2008 which ModernThink now operates independently and administers annually. This program surveys hundreds of thousands of employees at over two hundred institutions simultaneously every spring. This process includes both a survey of each college s employees as well as an audit of their people practices. The combination of the two assessments allows us to see what programs, benefits and approaches are working on the top colleges each year as well as the pain points that keep institutions from thriving. We have worked with institutions in good times, and bad, and have become adept at supporting institutions in the midst of transition and/or crisis. We have conducted assessments for institutions exploring mergers and consolidations; collected data to inform large scale change including new shared services and/or budgeting models; and supported presidents, chancellors, and provosts at the outset of their tenures and during challenging times. What We Do - ModernThink What We Do We have been working with colleges and universities for over a decade, helping schools understand where they are on the continuum of workplace quality and then engage in data-based strategic planning to enhance academic and operational excellence. ModernThink s higher education focus and experience separates us from the crowd of organizations who routinely deploy culture/climate assessments. We know that employee engagement surveys designed for corporate environments do not capture the structures, processes, and challenges of faculty and staff within higher education. We have specifically designed the ModernThink Higher Education Insight Survey to measure the organizational dynamics and competencies unique to institutions of higher education. We also know that the workplace experience of faculty and staff ultimately impacts the student experience. Our ModernThink Higher Education Insight Survey , used in and outside of the Great Colleges to Work For program, measures the dynamics and competencies unique to higher education. For those institutions that survey on a regular cycle, the survey reports provide a key measure of progress. Institutions rely on this data for strategic planning, accreditation self-studies, and leadership team transitions. Our unique benchmarking provides an external perspective on how your institution measures up in a variety of areas including being recognized as a top college for workplace excellence. ModernThink s speaking engagements within higher education include but are not limited to the following: ACE (American Council on Education) NACUBO (National Association of College and University Business Officers) AAC&U (Association of American Colleges and Universities) CUPA-HR National CUPA-HR-Regionals NCCI (National Consortium for Continuous Improvement in Higher Education) The Rural Community College Alliance AIR Forum Our core competency is helping institutions assess and then improve their culture and climate. During the assessment phase, we gather feedback from key stakeholders including institutional leadership, staff, faculty, and students. We then provide detailed feedback on our findings including: Summarizing and synthesizing key themes, patterns and trends Highlighting strengths and weaknesses Uncovering potential risks Discussing what peers do when faced with similar challenges. Our ultimate goals are to recommend a path forward based on your institutions specific results, start strategic planning to address key areas and help you implement best practices to improve your culture. Survey - ModernThink Higher Education Surveys Overview Faculty & Staff Engagement Survey Exit Survey Student Insight Survey Leadership Transition Survey Systems & Consortia Overview ModernThink offers a number of fully customizable survey instruments within higher education, each with unparalleled benchmarking capabilities that range from as broad as Carnegie Classification to as specific as aspirational peers for a given college. Our database contains survey information from more than 1,200 institutions ranging from small liberal arts colleges to large research universities as well as both 4-year and 2-year colleges. The depth of data at our disposal, coupled with the agility of our proprietary survey engine, allow us to provide uniquely tailored client solutions and high-touch customer service and project management. Our surveys are designed to gather, summarize and synthesize feedback from a wide variety of campus stakeholders and then to help leaders understand key themes, trends and patterns so that they can make data-driven decisions. Their analysis is enhanced by tapping into ModernThink s unrivaled database of workplace metrics and best practices so that they can see how they compare to peers as well as how others are dealing with many of the same challenges that they face. Faculty & Staff Engagement Survey The ModernThink Higher Education Insight Survey is specifically designed to measure the organizational dynamics and competencies unique to institutions of higher education and is used as the principal assessment tool in the annual Great Colleges to Work For program. The survey instrument measures the extent to which faculty and staff are involved and engaged in your institution and ultimately, the health of the culture and quality of the workplace experience. The survey statements in the ModernThink Higher Education Insight Survey themselves, and the associated scales/dimensions, are derived not just from ModernThink research but also from existing employment engagement research. Insights into the drivers, competencies, and behaviors that influence employee engagement from The Conference Board, the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), The Baldrige Foundation and more were all considered in the development and ongoing maintenance of our instrument. Within higher education there are structures and dynamics that are unique to higher education , for example, the experience of shared governance; the dynamics between faculty and staff; and the perceived understanding and balance of an institution s mission of teaching, research, and service. Such dynamics are rarely considered in generalized employee engagement research. However, given our understanding of how important these elements are within Higher Education we have developed survey items that specifically address these critical topics. ModernThink regularly convenes a blue-ribbon panel of experts and professionals from across higher education to solicit input and review the ModernThink Higher Education Insight Survey to ensure that it remains current and reflective of today s academic workplace. The most recent panel was convened in 2021 to address workplace changes influenced by the Covid-19 Pandemic. The core ModernThink Higher Education Insight Survey includes 55 belief statements and 5 Faculty Experience statements, intended for Faculty and Adjunct Faculty respondents. The instrument utilizes a five-point agreement scale (Strongly Agree, Agree, Sometimes Agree/Sometimes Disagree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree), along with a Not Applicable response option. The core survey instrument also includes a 20-item benefits satisfaction component, two open-ended questions, and eight demographic questions (e.g., Gender, Age, Race/Ethnicity, Job Classification,School/College and Department/Division). The belief statements of the ModernThink Higher Education Insight Survey are typically grouped and reported out in a series of dimensions and indices (Note: we use the term dimensions in lieu of scales, the composition of the dimensions is determined by confirmatory factor analysis). Why Use The Survey Compare your campus climate to that of peer institutions by size, region, Carnegie, and more Gather employee insights on a new initiative, project, or practice Develop a strategic plan or evaluate the effectiveness of strategic plan implementation Fulfill accreditation or funding requirements Measure campus engagement before, during, or after a change in leadership Assess differences in campus climate across a state or regional college system About the Innovation Index In partnership with NCCI (the Network for Change and Continuous innovation in Higher Education)",

Without expert advice, it s easy to miss out on various tax benefits, which could lead to higher payments than necessary. By understanding the deductions, credits, and exemptions available to you, we can make the most of your tax situation. Short-term, effective tax planning can mean more money in your pocket. Long-term, tax planning can positively influence many aspects of life, from funding your children s education to ensuring your financial stability in retirement. If you haven t started tax planning yet, there s no better time than now to begin. Taking these steps early can set you up for financial success both now and in the future. How long will it take to get my refund? If your return is e-filed, it usually takes up to 21 days for the IRS to process your refund. Direct deposit is the fastest way to get your refund. If you choose a refund by paper check, it will be mailed to the address on your return. If you would like to check the status of your refund, you may check on the IRS website here . How do I send my tax documents to you? We use SafeSend as a one-stop shop for gathering client tax documents, distributing sensitive information, and collecting e-signatures for various authorization forms. After you are established as a client, we will send you an invite to our Client Portal via SafeSend. Here, you may securely upload any documents that we might need to file your tax return. If you do not have a portal, you can upload your documents here . How long will it take to prepare my tax return? We need at least six weeks to prepare and review a tax return before it is ready for you to sign. Preparation time depends on the complexity of the return, your timeline in getting us any additional information we request, and the time of year. February through April and August through October are our busiest times of the year. I have another tax related inquiry. Visit our Key Tax Considerations page for more information. 02 Audit & Assurance Is every nonprofit organization required to have an audit? In the state of Washington, charitable organizations with more than three million in annual gross revenue, averaged over three preceding years, are required to obtain an independent financial statement audit. Not-for-profit organizations may also be required to obtain an audit as a result of requirements in your bylaws, grant terms, debt covenants, or other conditions imposed by a third party. What is the difference between an audit and a review? An audit provides reasonable assurance that the financial statements do not contain any material misstatements. This is achieved through inquiries of management, analytical procedures, and substantive tests of transactions on a sample basis. A review provides limited assurance that material changes are not needed for the financial statements to be in accordance with generally accepted accounted principles (GAAP) or other applicable basis of accounting. Review engagements primarily involve inquiries of management and analytical procedures applied to management s financial data. What is a Single Audit and who is required to undergo one? A Single Audit is an audit of compliance with major federal award program requirements and with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Single Audits are required for organizations that expend $750,000 or more of federal award funds during their fiscal year. For fiscal years ending September 30, 2025, and later, this threshold increases to $1,000,000. Who is required to undergo an employee benefit audit? A 401(k) plan or 403(b) plan generally needs an audit if it has 100 or more participants with account balances on the first day of the plan year. This is known as the large plan threshold. However, there is an exception to this rule called the 80/120 rule . Plans with between 80 and 120 participants with account balances can avoid an audit if they filed as a small plan in the previous year. If you are unsure whether or not your retirement plan needs an audit please don t hesitate to reach out to our assurance team for assistance. 03 CFO & Accounting Services How can CAS benefit my business? CAS offers several benefits, such as cost savings by eliminating the need to hire full-time accounting staff, access to specialized expertise, improved financial reporting and compliance, and the ability to focus on growing your business rather than managing day-to-day accounting tasks. What accounting software does GO typically use for CAS? Common accounting software platforms used includes QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks, Bill.com, and multiple payroll platforms (ADP, Paychex, Gusto, Paycom). What should I expect from the GO CAS department in terms of reporting and communication? At GO, we customize financial reporting to meet your specific needs, typically delivering reports between the 15th and 20th of each month. We also schedule regular communication, either monthly or quarterly, to review financial performance, address any concerns, and plan for future goals. Additionally, our team is committed to responding to emails within one business day. Our Clients Contact Ready to GO?

CLICK HERE to learn about my four personal growth and Buddhist-themed books -- all four also available to read on any device as FREE flipbooks. CLICK HERE to watch my thirteen music and narrated YouTube videos. About Mike Lisagor (Me!) I'm an author & columnist, a retired government contractor marketing & project management expert and a blues/jazz musician. Once upon a time, I was an aerospace and IT engineer, and then an industry executive. I finally relinquished his suit and tie to start a consulting company, Celerity Works , in 1999 where I advised over 500 company and government executives and managers. Now retired (from work), I recently founded GiveTeensHope.org to encourage young people in these difficult times and to promote my latest book, Eleven Life Lessons for Teenagers (& Everyone Else) . which is now a free Flipbook. I spend most of my time speaking to teenagers, writing essays and books, raising money with (and for) my wife of 55 years for MS research and services, creating graphic art, attending Buddhist discussion meetings, seeing a wonderful therapist, playing piano, harmonica and singing with local musicians, and weather permitting, hiking. My wife and I live on a beautiful island in the Pacific Northwest. More stuff about me! Based on the presentation I've given to over 3,000 high school students, Eleven Life Lessons for Teenagers (and Everyone Else ) is a 50-page guide (now also a FREE Flipbook) filled with wisdom and insight for teens and parents who're looking for help responding to their teenager's concerns. Intertwined with an honest sharing of my own personal challenges are the answers to eleven of teen s most pressing questions including making a difference in the world, dealing with depression and anxiety, making mistakes, getting bad grades, improving relationships, taking risks, and finding hope in a challenging world. My solitary endeavors during COVID isolation (including playing music withour band, Good Karma Blues, in my garage) culminated in four published books: The Essential Guide to Managing a Government Projects and How to Win in the Government Market (with Mark Amtower), The Muse Within: Unlocking Spiritual Growth Through the Eyes of 34 Writers, Artists, Musicians and Philosophers and My 50 Years of Buddhist Practice , I'm also the author of How to Develop a Winning SBIR Proposal (with Eric Adolphe). I've produced numerous webinars (many are still on YouTube!) and written several hundred magazine columns, articles, and blog posts on a variety of business and Buddhist-related topics. I'm also the author of Romancing the Buddha (fourth edition) which I adapted and performed as a successful one-man show that can be watched on YouTube . My nature photographs have appeared in the Boston Globe, Bainbridge Island Magazine, Living Buddhism as well as in several galleries. My latest project utilized Chat-AI and Photoshop to create a series of ten posters for the lobby of New Motion Physcal Therapy.

Skip to content Get ting legal help can some times appear unnec es sary in the mod ern world Courts are mak ing forms more avail able to the pub lic for things like name changes and dis so lu tion of mar riages, and every one has the inter net as a poten tial resource. So why hire a lawyer? Can t you just do it on your own? Can t I just do it on my own? In most instances, the basic forms pro vid ed by a Court are only one part of the case. Motions, dis cov ery, and court hear ings are a reg u lar part of many areas of law. When it comes to nego ti at ing with oth er par ties or per suad ing the Court, a lawyer knows which argu ments are like ly to be best received or should be avoid ed. Court rooms can be intim i dat ing, and lawyers who work reg u lar ly with Court staff can nav i gate this world for you. What about templates I can buy on the web? Legal forms are only one small part of com plet ing a legal task. For the cre ation of a Will or Trust, what is in or left out of that doc u ment can make the dif fer ence in your loved ones futures. Lawyers also know how oth er Lawyers oper ate, and can be an effec tive way to nego ti ate cas es where ten sions might run high. In oth er areas of the law those online forms may be entire ly out of date or oth er wise non com pli ant with the law. How would you know? This is a simple issue, we ll never go to court! Even if your case nev er has you in a court room, Lawyers are trained to issue spot and find the poten tial pit falls in every sce nario. If you re an inex pe ri enced camper, the first time you go into the wilder ness a map might get you halfway there, but a guide with first aid and sur vival expe ri ence is bet ter if things go awry. Since you nev er know when things will go awry ahead of time, its best to plan. A lawyer is a pro fes sion al. This one-time event in your life is what we do over and over, for a living. Can t I just wait and see if it this issue becomes a real problem and then hire you? We are always here for you, when ev er you re ready. One of the rea sons we like to get involved ear ly is because we can help pre vent issues from becom ing larg er problems. We hope all legal mat ters are han dled effi cient ly and inex pen sive ly- and if they are, hav ing a lawyer at your side will not sub stan tial ly increase the finan cial bur den. It will alle vi ate a lot of anx i ety and guilt over your own abil i ties, too. OK . Maybe I need a lawyer- why should we choose you ? Why Hire Bridge Law? Skip to content How do I trust someone I ve never met? Hir ing an attor ney is like going to the doc tor- most peo ple don t do it until its an emer gency because they don t think they can afford it.

Since establishing our MCM Program and through the collective efforts from our team with MCM we have generated nearly $1.4 Million in credits for our Company that have offset federal income taxes dollar for dollar! Tax Manager, Food Processing Company I think really it s a situation where we have a shared goal. The tax credits benefit us, while they benefit McKenzie Chase as well. And obviously that s an acceptable arrangement and one that benefits both companies. Owner, Marketing Research Firm. I don t think we would be able to get the tax credits they re able to get for us in a timely manner, It s saved us a lot of time and money. Payroll Administrator, Agriculture Firm. You know, owners want to see their hotels making money, and they want to see some growth on their end so if they can get money back without having to put in a ton of work it s good all around. HR Generalist, Hotel Management Firm. I was really pleased with the effort that McKenzie Chase put in, in contacting all of our locations because we have multiple locations and we re spread all over multiple states and they worked with us. Controller and HR Manager, Security Services Company. So the tax credits come rolling in- you see it, and you re just excited- and you speak with the owners and they re excited as well and it s good on both ends. HR Manager, Marketing Research, Call Center With the payroll tax credits they did go the extra mile because that was a lot more paperwork for them to go through and like I said, any questions I ever have they had the answer right away Office Manager, Food Processing Firm. I mean it s easy it s easy admin work for me. Basically we hire when we do hiring we sign the back of a sheet, mail it in, and look for the tax credits I mean it s very easy work for us here. HR Manager, Answering Service. It s just been wonderful. We don t worry about anything, they ve proven themselves to be very accurate, the information they provide back to us is detailed. Payroll Administrator, Agricultural Firm. You know with Mike, with McKenzie Chase, I feel totally comfortable just giving Mike the reigns so I don t have to deal with it, one less thing to work with our hotels is great, so yeah its been really nice. HR Assistant, Hotel Management Firm. The thing I love about McKenzie Chase is I can pick up the phone and call Mike, and he says, I got it, I m emailing it over to you. And so response time. And having that personal relationship, and just knowing that I can call and I can talk to the person already handling my company s program. Regional Controller, Hotel Management Firm. I would say MCM is very responsive. You know most of the time he s so proactive he didn t have to respond to anything I m asking because he s already there, giving me what I needed. Controller, Security Guard and Patrol Company. I don t think it gets any simpler like that when you can outsource something that someone has a specialty in that that s their primary focus and responsibility it makes it much easier as a management company to have one less thing on our plate. Controller, Security Guard and Patrol Service. Well it s seamless, there are so many things you just don t have to bother yourself with because they handle the whole part of that as far as all the paperwork, all the guidelines. Chief Financial Officer, Fruit Grower and Shipper. You can do a lot of little things in a mediocre way? Or you can concentrate on what you re good at. And, I want to concentrate on what I m good at and and together we make a good team. Controller, Security Services Firm. Total Service from MCM provides you everything you need to maximize your hiring incentives, and minimize your efforts. Before you even know what you need MCM has it for you at your fingertips.

The Work Opportunity Tax Credit program (WOTC) was introduced on October 1, 1996, to provide tax incentives for employers who hire individuals from specific target groups. People from these target groups have been identified by the U.S. government as having historically high unemployment rates. After introducing the WOTC program to our clients in 1996, McKenzie Chase Management went online, introducing Electronic Tax Credits in 2009 with a simple, fast, tax credit system that applicants could complete in less than 2 minutes, without the need for help pages or tutorials by anyone. Through WOTC, employers can earn a tax credit per qualified employee; these tax credits can be applied to employers income taxes, reducing the amount they owe the IRS. Including online screening for tax credits. Currently, McKenzie Chase Management offers the MCM Online System free to clients including a WOTC Hub for multi-location clients. In addition to the electronic online systems on-paper tax credit programs are supported with free pre-addressed envelopes, online secure server support, and monthly activity reports. Tax Credits McKenzie Chase Management offers a suite of tax credit and employer incentive services designed to save your company money with little effort on your part. In many cases, you can enjoy savings without changing company business practices.
