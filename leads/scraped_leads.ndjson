However when I do, her pleasant voice and excellent phone manners complete the impression I get of a total professional. In this day and age, customer service and hard working people can be difficult to find. This is not the case with your company.

Patients in Need Since 2002, we ve treated more than 4.8M patients in underserved communities. 82% of these patients are enrolled in either Medicaid or their state CHIP program. The number of children not visiting the dentist or going to hospital ERs for dental related issues nationally tells us too many of them lack the primary care they need to prevent serious dental issues. Because these health issues can impact children s ability to perform their best in school and live a successful life, we are dedicated to supporting our communities.
