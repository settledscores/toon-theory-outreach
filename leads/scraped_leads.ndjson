Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at Arch CPA takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Arch CPA who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nClients end up dropping these videos into proposals, landing pages, even training. They're really versatile.\n\nTotally optional, but I’d be glad to send over a first-pass sketch. Just to play around with.\n\nReply anytime if it feels like something you’d want to chat more about.

A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like The Human Resource Edge who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nOnce you’ve got one of these videos, you can drop it into all sorts of places such as your homepage or even newsletters where words fail to keep up.\n\nIf you want to see what this might look like for The Human Resource Edge, I could whip up a quick snippet, say 10 seconds.

We help businesses like your's show what they mean; especially when it’s the kind of thing that’s tricky to summarize in one sentence.\n\nIf it takes three paragraphs to explain what you do at Practical PM, then it’s probably time for a video. We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nThis might be easier to show than tell; happy to put a no-cost sample together if you’re up for it.\n\nYou’re free to ignore this, but if you're at all interested, reply anytime. A few past projects are mentioned below in my signature. Just say 'NO' if you'd prefer no future messages.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",

If not interested, replying “NO” will stop future messages.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nIf it takes three paragraphs to explain what you do at IRM Consulting & Advisory, then it’s probably time for a video. We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re quick to watch and easy to share; kind of like a visual elevator pitch you can repurpose, even on your landing pages or pitch decks.\n\nIf you're even a little curious, I can sketch a 10-second snippet just for you to test the waters.\n\nIf any part of this felt interesting, you can always reply. Some previous projects are listed in the signature.

A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Transcounts Services who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nI'd be happy to mock up a small piece; maybe a 10-second snippet; to give you a sense of how this could sound.\n\nNo rush; reply if you're even slightly interested. You can take a peek at what we’ve done before in my signature.

We don’t do flashy — just clear, human videos that help small B2B teams say more with less.\n\nWe’ve worked with teams like Benefit 4 You who have a lot going on: layered offers, custom solutions, you name it. Our videos help connect the dots without adding more work to your plate. That's because we do it all in-house, with minimal effort on your end.\n\nThese videos short, punchy, and surprisingly sticky. People keep watching and re-watching. And they tend to travel well; from landing pages to pitches and everything in between.\n\nIf it sounds halfway interesting, I’d be glad to draw something up; just a loose draft to react to.\n\nIf you're curious at all, feel free to reply. There’s some previous work listed in my signature. And if this isn’t for you, just reply 'NO'.\n\nYours truly,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nAnimation for experts who need to sound less 'expert-y'.",

I run Toon Theory, it’s just a few of us drawing stories for folks whose work doesn’t always fit neatly into a sentence.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at Taxvisors takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Taxvisors who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nHappy to send over a short teaser if you want to see what it might feel like in practice.\n\nIf you're curious at all, feel free to reply. There’s some previous work listed in my signature. And if this isn’t for you, just reply 'NO'.\n\nThanks,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

I mentioned how whiteboard animation could support Taxvisors’s messaging ; and I still believe there’s a great fit here.\n\nThese videos are especially helpful when you’re trying to explain something technical, strategic, or new in a way that sticks.\n\nIf it helps, I’d be happy to put together a short script or quick teaser to show what this could look like.\n\nFeel free to reply if you’d like to explore it. You’ll find examples of our work in my signature. If it’s not a fit, feel free to reply with a quick “NO” and I won’t reach out again.\n\nRespectfully,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nTrusted by consultants, coaches, and businesses who care about clarity.",
  "email 3": "Hi Omer,\n\nI am still happy to share a quick sketch or demo if it is helpful. Many of our clients use animation to break down services, explain strategy, or walk users through dashboards and pages.\n\nIf Taxvisors has anything you are trying to simplify, I would love to help you explore it. Just reply if you want me to send something over.\n\nYou will also find examples of past work in my signature below.\n\nRegards,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",

I run Toon Theory, it’s just a few of us drawing stories for folks whose work doesn’t always fit neatly into a sentence.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at Prosperity Planning takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Prosperity Planning who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem.

One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThese videos slot in easily wherever you need a quick *‘here’s what we do’*; such as your homepage, sales calls, newsletters or whatever.\n\nI could mock something up if you want to see how it might look like with your brand's voice behind it.\n\nYou can reply whenever if this seems worth exploring.

We use doodles and voiceover to help teams explain what they do when the message is hard to pin down.\n\nI know Smarttax delivers bundled services that aren’t easy to summarize in one email or pitch deck. Even smart prospects can tune out if things aren’t quite framed right. These videos fix that. Our explainers do that job in under two minutes, with zero input needed on your end.\n\nMost teams keep reusing them. They're really helpful on landing pages, in follow-ups, or even onboarding flows.\n\nI could sketch something out if you’re curious; nothing polished, just a rough idea to react to.\n\nNo rush; reply if you're even slightly interested. You can take a peek at what we’ve done before in my signature. Also say 'NO' if you don't want me to reach out again.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nTrusted by consultants, coaches, and businesses who care about clarity.",

Even smart prospects can tune out if things aren’t quite framed right. These videos fix that. Our explainers do that job in under two minutes, with zero input needed on your end.\n\nThey’re quick to watch and easy to share; kind of like a visual elevator pitch you can repurpose, even on your landing pages or pitch decks.\n\nLet me know if you want a quick visual mock; no deck, no pitch, just a sketch.\n\nYou’re free to ignore this, but if you're at all interested, reply anytime. A few past projects are mentioned below in my signature.

We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nMost teams keep reusing them. They're really helpful on landing pages, in follow-ups, or even onboarding flows.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I could put together a quick sketch or sample script; just something to see if the tone feels right.\n\nHappy to hear from you if this caught your eye. You’ll find some examples down below if you’d like to browse; or just reply 'NO' if you’d rather not get follow-ups.\n\nFaithfully,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",

And they tend to travel well; from landing pages to pitches and everything in between.\n\nI’d be happy to whip out a quick script or 10 second snippet if you want to see what it could look like for Keller & Owens.\n\nYou can reply whenever if this seems worth exploring.

We draw whiteboard videos to simplify what people usually need more than one paragraph to explain.\n\nTeams like Elevated Tax Strategies that deliver bundled, multi-layered offerings often need help showing how it all fits together. That’s what we do: clear videos that explain it all, zero lift on your side.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nI could mock something up if you want to see how it might look like with your brand's voice behind it.\n\nIf any part of this felt interesting, you can always reply.

  "email 1": "Hi Julie, No fluff here, just a small idea I wanted to toss your way.\n\nI’m Trent. I make short videos at a studio called Toon Theory. Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at SDHR Consulting takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like SDHR Consulting who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThese videos are pretty low-lift; most folks use them across their homepage, email, or even onboarding.\n\nLet me know if you want a quick visual mock; no deck, no pitch, just a sketch.\n\nYou’re free to ignore this, but if you're at all interested, reply anytime. A few past projects are mentioned below in my signature. Just say 'NO' if you'd prefer no future messages.\n\nRespectfully,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nTrusted by consultants, coaches, and businesses who care about clarity.",
