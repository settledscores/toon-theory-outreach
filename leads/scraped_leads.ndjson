Additional Savings Tax Planning Session Tax Planning Session Customers who sign-up for tax planning will save 25% on tax preparation fees. We want to make sure that we help you see the savings through! FAQs Tax Planning Session FAQs Want to know what the process is like? See our FAQ! FAQs FAQs Frequently Asked Questions What should I expect in a Tax Planning Session? Clients should expect two meetings and some homework during the tax planning phase. The first meeting will be an overview of the process, the outline of the tasks, and an agreement to move forward. This is followed by a working session where we review last year's taxes, current year financial results, current year financial forecasts (or provide some guestimates). Often we can provide a questionnaire that the client can fill out in advance that will make the working session go faster. Then finally, we will prepare and present expected savinigs along with an implementatiion plan for making those savings happen. How much time should I plan on this? That's a good question. However, the real question is how much time is $10,000 or more in saviings worth to you? We typically say that clients should expect between 5 and 10 hours to complete the process as inputs to the preparation of the plan. If we save you $10,000 (often a lot more) and you spent 10 hours working on it - that would be $1,000 an hour! What if there are no significant savings? Every client worries that there will be no savings. It is rare and it does happen. If we can't find any savings, then there is no charge for the review. Its that simple. Are the savings a one-time saving? Sometimes yes, but often they are recurring annually - which means they re-occur every. Clients love finding annual savings - its like giving them a pay raise! Is this confidential? Absolutely. We are fearce about protecting our clients and their condifentiality. We treat you the way we expect to be treated.

It is a structure for supporting you to handle your own accounting work. A DFY (Done For You) solution. While DMR Accounting offers bookkeeping services, that is not what this program is about. A program for bookkeepers and financial staff. If you are in need of this kind of service, Deidra provides training for organizations. Please schedule an \"Are We a Fit?\" meeting to discuss your options. However, this YES! program is designed for entrepreneurs and small business owners. YES! PROGRAM We ve designed our Y ear-round E ntrepreneur S uccess P ackage to provide more structure, accountability, and predictability for your entire business - especially in your bookkeeping, accounting, and administrative functions. ONE-TO-ONE SESSIONS These are private sessions with Deidra that run up to 2 hours long (either in person or virtual). Use this time to get support with creating a regular rhythm in your bookkeeping and reports. You will know how to identify which timely financial reports are needed for you to be the best leader you can be. This structure also helps you face the dreaded procrastination bug! Sessions are NOT transferable from one period to the next. MONTHLY OFFICE HOUR CALLS Use these office hour calls for your as-needed additional support. Join the call to ask accounting, finance, and business questions in a safe and confidential environment. You may be surprised by the insights you can gain from other people's questions and shared experiences. Plus, you can celebrate your successes! Group calls are on the second Thursday of every month from 10:30 - 11:30 am CST. PRIVATE FACEBOOK GROUP FOR ENTREPRENEUR COMMUNITY A private Facebook group is set up as a third place for you to stay connected and get the support you need all year long. It's a great place to share your successes and wins, and post useful resources. Ready to Get Started? Pick the Plan that's Right for You. SHOULD I SIGN UP FOR THE YES! PROGRAM? If you are ... Hoping to ignore your accounting and think it will make things easier, Not concerned about a big surprise tax bill, Okay with being completely unprepared for a tax audit, Happy with a hobby approach to business, Not interested in learning, but prefer handing off the work to someone else, then this is probably not the right program for you.

I was lost with accounting specific to my work industry. I randomly found her contact info and read where some of her clients she worked for were mortgage brokers like myself. I emailed Julianne and asked her for some advice on content. She was generous and quick with her response I would recommend her any day! Quintin Pierce It is a real pleasure working with Financial Foothold, starting from the Founder Julianne, and onboarding specialist Dennice. It has really helped our business during the start-up phase and we look forward to working with them as we grow. Mark Raizen My tax and bookkeeping providers retired and I found myself without professional accountants going into tax season. I met Julianne Autry many years ago and contacted her for a referral. Lucky for me, Financial Foothold was able to take on my small business, tidying up my Quickbooks online and helped me close out my business for 22! A CPA referral has worked seamlessly and my S corporation return is now in process.My company is tiny but I was treated kindly, professionally and quickly! I recommend highly. Leif Anders We have been with Financial Foothold and Julianne for many years now and she has always gone above and beyond to help us with our business. Julianne treats her clients like friends so every interaction with Financial Foothold is enjoyable. She is so responsive with whatever you need. Small businesses have unique needs at times, and JA is always there to help us through it. The professionals that work for her and Financial Foothold are the exact same. We have had the pleasure of working with Shelby since she has taken over our account and daily needs. Shelby is outstanding. She responds to every need lightening fast with an awesome attitude and energy. I cannot possibly give any individual or firm that provides services for small businesses a better recommendation. We feel very fortunate to work with the great people of Financial Foothold. Special thanks to JA and Shelby! RD Straface Such a pleasure working with Julianne and Dennice. I've been doing the bookkeeping for our firm for 20 years and I really wish I would have switched sooner. They make things so easy and work so quickly. So lucky to have found them.

Will Rogers Subscribe to our Emailed Newsletter Austin, TX CPA : Accounting, Tax Planning & Payroll Estate Tax Planning Estate Tax Planning Estate planning on your own can be complicated and costly. And the list is endless... state taxes, bureaucracy, probate courts, unfair appraisals, health care concerns, eligibility of heirs, life insurance, annuities, burial or cremation costs, and intent regarding death-postponing treatment to name a few. Not knowing your legal and financial rights often ends up costing you more in the end. Thoughts of estate planning often bring more questions than answers: Could an heir be too young to inherit? Should the inheritance be given at a certain age? Is the intended beneficiary in a shaky marriage with divorce as a possibility? Are there children from a previous marriage? Should inheritance be protected from potential creditors of the heir? Are there taxes that can be avoided? Are you able to avoid the probate court rules, delays, and costs? Planning what happens to your estate when you're gone can seem frustrating and intimidating without qualified help. You may feel that you're too young to care about estate planning. Or, perhaps the reminder of death makes you uncomfortable. You might be tempted to put the whole thing off, assuming that it will just take care of itself. In all cases, estate planning ends up saving your family lots of time, heartache and money. And we can help. Every estate planning situation is different. In order to help you, we want to know you, your unique situation, and the nature of your relationships. We offer discussion, recommendations and useful research tools to make your planning simple, efficient, and worry-free. We are available throughout the process for further discussion regarding questions, change of circumstances, and alternatives. At every step, we'll be there with you. We help you... Clearly define your estate planning goals. Organize and create your estate planning team (experts on law, finance, and taxes) if you need one. Evaluate and recommend estate planning options. Prepare, organize and review your estate planning documents including current wills, trusts, health care and power of attorney. Decrease the problems and expenses associated with probate. Lessen taxes at time of death. Arrange for management of your estate in the event you are incapacitated. Draft a working plan for conserving and effectively managing your estate after death. Transfer the assets of your estate to heirs the way you want. Organize fair and adequate liquidation of estate to cover taxes and other expenses. Amend your plan as needed. You also get help with... Living Wills and Trusts. Lifetime Family Wealth Transfers. Family partnerships and other business relationships. Leaving money to charities. Preparation for estate and trust tax problems. The hassles and red tape associated with estate planning can be daunting, but you don't need to do it alone. Our team is waiting to assist you through every step of the process.

Will Rogers Subscribe to our Emailed Newsletter Austin, TX CPA : Accounting, Tax Planning & Payroll Small Business Accounting Small Business Accounting As a small business owner you have more important things to do than to keep your own books. We take care of your books for you, so you can get back to the job of running your business and generating profits! Each month or quarter we'll do the following things for you... Reconcile your bank account Clean up your general ledger Provide unlimited consultations These tasks form the solid foundation of your small business accounting system. You can customize the package of services you receive by adding payroll, tax planning, tax preparation, or any of our other services. Bank Reconciliation Reconciling your business checking account each month allow us to keep your bank account, accounting, and taxes up-to-date. Having us reconcile your account each month allows you to... Identify lost checks, lost deposits and unauthorized wire transactions. Detect and prevent excess/unjustified bank charges and ensures transactions are posted correctly by your bank. Detect and prevent embezzlement of funds from within your company. Know how your business is doing? You can't really know unless all accounts are reconciled and properly accounted for on your financial statement. Manage your cash more effectively. Proper management of funds not only saves money, it makes money for you. Protect yourself. By timely reconciling and promptly objecting to your bank about any unauthorized, fraudulent or forged checks presented to your bank and paid by that bank, you can relieve your agency of responsibility for the shortfall and transfer the risk to the bank. This reason to reconcile alone should be enough. Crime exists. Sleep Better. You will sleep more peacefully at night knowing your bank accounts are reconciled, in balance and that all escrow funds, accounts, checks and disbursed funds are properly accounted for. Maintaining a Clean General Ledger The general ledger is the core of your company's financial records. These records constitute the central \"books\" of your system. Since every transaction flows through the general ledger, a problem with your general ledger throws off all your books. Having us review your general ledger system each month allows us to hunt down any discrepancies such as double billings or any unrecorded payments. Then we'll fix the discrepancies so your books are always accurate and kept in tip top shape. Unlimited Consultations We are always available to spend time with you so you fully understand how to interpret and utilize the financial information we provide. Our consultations are already included in our price, so please feel free to call us whenever you have a question or concern.

Order your copy today in paper back or Kindle version on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Later-Lessons-Ron-Jackson/dp/B08KBQS94P What reviews say \"This was an excellent read. It s like having an intriguing discussion with two of your best friends after sharing a meal you all cooked together. It s familiar and warm. Guaranteed you will see yourself (and your friends/family) in love relationships that could have used these bits of wisdom and reflections from beginning to end. I really like the exploration of being evenly yoked culturally. It plays a big part in understanding one s intrinsic values and if cohesion/compromise isn t valued at the beginning...incompatibility is going to show up. This was a well-written, first book from a couple you can tell has a mature love and true friendship. It s honest and endearing. Hoping for more titles to come as they journey through life. Grab your loved one, teens or young adult children, family members or friends and read this one together. Should make for some interesting discoveries\". -Reader - Aniki https://www.amazon.com/Later-Lessons-Ron-Jackson/dp/B08KBQS94P Product bottom of page",

Client Highlights You could see the same efficiencies in your business. Let s Get Started! Get Started Automotive Industry We designed, developed, and implemented a process to convert an engineer-focused Method of Manufacturing ( MOM ) to a shop floor-optimized MOM and reverse. This solution was designed to accommodate MOM revision after the start of production and with existing labor reporting. Savings include: 24 hours of reoccurring manual engineering reduced to approximately 54 seconds. Structural Manufacturing Our client manufactures-to-spec CAD-designed mezzanines for industrial centers (Amazon, Target, etc). We designed an integration to break down the CAD BOM into a list of shippable components on the Sales Order, then generated a list of tracked jobs for progressive shipment and onsite assembly. Approximately 440 detailer man-hours per week. Component Distribution High-volume shipments of visually similar components serving multiple industries caused our client to have an approximate 17% shipping error rate. By implementing an inventory control system through training, labeling, and process reinforcement, we reduced the shipping error rate to 2.5% in the first month, and it is now approximately .25%. 85% improvement in shipping accuracy in the first month with improved customer relations. Between 10k-15k dollars in corrective shipping charges monthly.

Mason Our clients are a diverse group that come to us with a wide range of problems we help them solve. Below are just a sampling of the situations we've provided solutions for, actions taken and results achieved. INCREASED FUNDING Situation: A social enterprise focused on recruiting and retaining teachers of color did not have a robust strategic plan with clear goals, metrics and actions. This critical gap negatively impacted outcomes and funding. Action taken: We worked with the client to identify their key focus areas and core processes. We also developed goals, objectives, metrics, and actions. The new strategic plan was overhauled to drive results. Result: The client's new two-year strategic plan enabled them to secure multiple six figure grants and additional funding through the RFP process. SCHEDULE YOUR SESSION TODAY! PRIORITIZATION IS KEY Situation: A program provider for urban youth treated most tasks with equal priority, resulting in a staff that was stretched and stressed out. Action taken: The Optimist strategist worked with the client to create customized tools for project tracking and process mapping for the client s major programs. The strategist also created tools for managing unexpected stakeholder project requests. Result: The staff can now track program milestones and better prioritize their work. The tools used have improved communication within the organization and communication with community stakeholders, as well as reduced the stress felt by the staff members. INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY & EFFICIENCY Situation: The project management firm's procurement process was taking far too long. Once an agreement was reached with a new client, it was taking the organization a long time to complete and sign the contract. Action: The Optimist strategist worked with the client s team to map out the contracting process. This allowed the team to identify opportunities to eliminate unnecessary steps and to execute other steps in parallel. The future-state map created by Optimist for the client revealed an opportunity to go from a 49% process efficiency to a 77% process efficiency. Result: The Client is already seeing the benefits of a more efficient formal process for completing and approving contracts. 40% INCREASE IN CLOSURE RATE = SATISFIED CLIENTS Situation: This woman-owned marketing firm has recently experienced a significant decline in its client closure rate (the finalizing of a contract after proposal submission), and they didn t know why. Action: The Optimist strategist worked with the firm s leadership team to apply six sigma strategies for obtaining customer feedback and identifying root causes for the decline. Result: The firm responded to the customer feedback by adding another touchpoint to the contract closing process to hear and address client concerns. The client closure rate increased by 40%. OVERWHELMED WITH DATA Situation: The leader of an educational institution was overwhelmed with data. With 1000+ data points, a plan was needed for data analysis and an action plan was needed to address themes. The institution's limited capacity and competing priorities were prohibitive",

Installment Contract If you find yourself unable to meet your tax obligations due to financial constraints, you may consider applying for a status known as Currently Not Collectible (CNC). This designation informs the IRS that, at present, you lack the means to settle your tax liabilities. It s imperative to include thorough documentation demonstrating your financial incapacity to repay the debts; failure to do so could result in denial of your request 2. Installment Agreement for Partial Payment If you re unable to manage a short-term tax installment plan, you have the option to negotiate for a partial payment installment arrangement. This allows you to make payments in smaller increments over time. It s important to note that there s usually a maximum timeframe of around ten years for such arrangements. Given the unconventional nature of this payment method and the importance of maintaining a positive relationship with the IRS, consulting with your settlement and resolution officer is advisable to avoid potential IRS assessments. 3. At this time, not collectible If you re burdened with a significant backlog of unpaid taxes, opting for an installment agreement can help you divide the amount into more manageable payments. This approach simplifies the process and alleviates the stress associated with making a large lump-sum payment. By establishing a monthly payment schedule, you can effectively manage your tax obligations over time. 4. Innocent Spouse You can prevent the transfer of tax liability from one spouse to another by filing as an innocent spouse. It s unjust for one spouse to bear responsibility for the other s tax debt, particularly if it predates the marriage. Filing as an innocent spouse provides a means to protect yourself from undue financial burden in such circumstances. 5. In-Compromise Offer If you re unable to settle your entire tax liability due to financial constraints, you have the option to submit an Offer in Compromise (OIC) form. This form notifies the IRS that, while you re willing to pay a reduced amount, you lack the means to pay the full tax bill. Similar to the CNC form, you must substantiate your inability to pay the debt in full with supporting documentation. Upon acceptance of the form, you re required to provide updated financial statements monthly. It s important to note that once your income surpasses the OIC cutoff, you ll be expected to resume paying the full amount. 6. Expired Returns Filing your tax return after the deadline can result in additional fees or interest assessments. However, you can swiftly address this issue by submitting a past-due return form. By doing so, you may qualify for a tax refund on any overpaid amounts, potentially providing additional savings. 7. Penalty Reduction If you ve incurred any type of tax penalty, you have the option to apply for an abatement to reduce or completely eliminate the fines.

T&T Tax Relief got me compromises for both debts in under 6 months. I would recommend this services to anyone who is in need of professional help. Mr. Donald Albert Rebecca & Patrick Olsen My husband and I were in serious trouble and we did not see any way out. We were to the point where we were going to file bankruptcy because of our tax debt. We found Toledo & Toledo Tax Relief and learned about the services they could provide. As soon as we signed up, we were protected! The notices stopped coming in and the IRS informed us of the pending settlement with 4 weeks after signing up. To our surprise they were able to settle our $20,000 debt for $100. Curtis & Wendy Smith My problem started when I retired with my wife. I was under the assumption that taxes were being withheld from my retirement distributions but they were not. I let a few years go by and did not file my taxes. Well into our retirement we started to receive notices from the IRS, notifying that they had filed on my behalf and I owed them large sums of money. I had no way to pay what they were asking for. The IRS started to levy my Social Security benefits and we started falling behind on all our bills. After contacting these guys they made sure I was take care of. The following month's Social Security benefit was for the full amount. They were able to reach an agreement with the IRS for far less than what I owed. Thanks Toledo & Toledo Tax Relief!

FAQS Can I handle this on my own?

Choosing to address and resolve your tax issues is a significant decision, and it s natural to have reservations. While the decision is ultimately yours, it s crucial to recognize that delaying only makes resolving your tax debt more challenging. The longer you wait, the higher the likelihood of the IRS or State taking direct action, such as wage garnishment, property liens, or property seizure. I owe state income tax. Can you assist?

This being the first time getting my taxes done as an adult I was nervous and really had no idea where to start. After a couple minutes of being on the phone l felt confident that I made the right decision. They not only answered all my questions, as stupid as they may have been, but they also took the time to help me understand the process. I feel confident I got the best possible refund. They were also flexible to my somewhat crazy schedule. Thank you for such great service! Jake Kaiser Google \"Choosing Amity One to help with my tax situation was one of the better business decisions I ve made. I was of course skeptical at first. Once I spoke to Andrew I was sure God was guiding me in the right direction. They were very informative and at least seemed to be genuinely compassionate about my situation.

Steve Nomura United Vision Investment University CoWork has been great for my wealth management and financial investments firm. Located in Merrillville, Indiana, our second location was in downtown Chicago. We wanted a professional office with a more neighborhood feel that is accessible to our south side Chicago clients. When University CoWork opened last year, we immediately closed our expensive downtown office and got a $95 flexible membership, and then upgraded to a $295 dedicated desk. This allows us to do occasional work on the south side of Chicago. We now have a professional presence, and can meet our clients at our office closer to where they work and live. I love the phone and meeting rooms. Great technology. We are able to offer our clients parking and coffee in our beautiful new space. Our firm also hosts investment events in the University CoWork boardroom, classroom, and event spaces. Sharon Mallory CEO, SDM Investments Every aspect of University CoWork is superb! Since moving to Woodlawn in 2007, I have searched for suitable local office space for my law firm. I was happy to learn about University CoWork last year and eager to see the space and its amenities. The private offices, co-working spaces and common areas were all thoughtfully designed and built with highest quality finishes. University CoWork also offers far more than just professional office space. University CoWork is a welcoming community that monthly hosts networking and small business development programs and other events. I feel fortunate to be part of this vibrant community and urge those looking for local office space to visit University CoWork.

He helped me acquire national and international clients during the most difficult business environment since the Great Depression. University CoWork helped me maintain consistent work during the pandemic, even during a pandemic construction depression in our territory. He propelled me to engage remote workers in the U.S. and abroad to keep my business growing despite the severe shortage of labor in the Chicago area. As other service businesses contracted, David s encouragement propelled me to leverage our tech stack, deep and unique subject matter expertise, and international contacts to prosper in uncertain times.

TESTIMONIALS UPCOMING CLASSES DEEP MAGIC GROUPS Testimonial of Kathleen McGarry Testimonial of Kayli Larkin Melissa Sandfort A Thousand Paths 0 My passion and purpose in life is self-transformation. Sometimes my life focus is difficult to communicate, as in the following conversation with my world-traveling brother-in-law: Naimish : So, do you like to travel? Melissa : No, not really but, I like inner travel. Naimish : You like interstate travel? You like to travel in the United States? Melissa : Ah, no, I like to travel inside myself, INNER travel, inner adventures. To the different states of being inside me. Naimish : Oh. My earliest method of inner travel was reading books, before I had any tools for making my way safely and meaningfully through my own interior landscape. I remember so vividly the despair I felt when Meg was being menaced by the It at the end of A Wrinkle In Time . It was the summer between 2nd and 3rd grade, and my 8 year old self just couldn t read a sentence more, but I wanted to find out what happened! My grandmother found me with tears streaming down my face, holding a yellow book with a centaur on the cover. She asked, What s wrong? I finished the book sitting in her lap, crying to the very end. Even then, I wanted the forces of individuality and autonomy to win over the forces of sameness and control. I travel inside myself, and love my job as an inner travel guide for others on their journeys, because I know that the more I and everyone else travels within, the more fiercely, joyfully unique we all become. We individuate. We find out who we really are. We grow up into who we were meant to be. I want to live in a world full of individuated, grown up people who are living profoundly meaningful lives with passion and vision! What I find so amazing about inner travel is you get all the benefits of world travel meet new people! make new friends! see fantastic new things! without the hassle of cabs and airplanes, PLUS you strip away layers of inner defenses and psychological burdens at the same time. You get to leave some of your baggage behind, and become an authentically more powerful human being as a result. Every inner journey benefits the traveler, whether the outcome is wisdom, power, clarity, or simply a growing sense of confidence in one s ability to navigate the inner landscape. I love to accrue the benefits of self-travel: an expanded understanding of my own humanity and a deep, felt sense of my shared sisterhood and brotherhood with the people who live in the worlds within us all. We all have hurt little kids inside us, and inner critics, and nervous parts, and shame, and fear and loneliness and the longing to love and be loved we are all the same inside. Through my inner travels, I continue to connect more deeply to this truth. I continue to expand my capacity to love myself and to love others, and to help other people expand their capacity to love themselves and to love others. Melissa Love is the natural outcome of peering under the foundations of personality and meeting frightening beings in cobwebby places who end up becoming tender new friends. Virginia Woolf E. M. Forster said of Virginia Woolf, a great explorer of consciousness, that she gave acute pleasure in new ways, she pushed the light of the English language a little further against darkness. To bring light to darkness, to make friends with things that were feared, that were strangers; to be always accruing more light, more love: that is the life of the inner traveler. It is the life for me, the only life I can imagine living, and I m ecstatic to share the insights and joys of it with other fellow travelers, for a short stretch of the path, or a long one. In whatever way this website supports your journey, I m honored to be traveling with you, even if I never meet you. I know that every one of us strengthens all of us. I m glad you re here.

Amounts range from $ 10,000 to $ 1,000,000.

Most companies looking for working capital to buy inventory, or expand their business can benefit from SBA loans. Apply Now ! Term Loans If you are looking for a longer period, term loans are a great option. We offer term loans with a maturity of 1 to 5 years and a total loan amount of $ 20,000 to $2,000,000. Unlike traditional bank loans, there is no unnecessary paperwork and approval takes hours instead of weeks. Apply Now ! Consolidation Have existing debt or balances? In many cases, we're able to consolidate all your existing debt into one entity - reducing your financial burden and saving you money in the process. Apply Now ! Debt Relief Instead of paying the creditors, you pay monthly on your behalf to a special savings account under your control. Once the funds have accumulated, our partners will contact your creditors to negotiate and agree on a reduction in your balance. You then authorize them to use the funds in your private savings account to pay your creditors a reduced amount. When accounts are paid, they should be reported as zero balance. This should help your credit score recover. The faster you save, the less debt you will have. Apply Now ! Equipment Financing Buy new or used equipment for virtually every industry. Lower rates, larger amounts, longer terms, fast and easy process. Get the equipment you need to grow your business. Apply Now ! Invoice Factoring It can take anywhere from 30 to 90 days for most businesses to receive payments from their customers, which is a long time when you have immediate business needs and employees to pay. Factoring will pay you most of the invoiced amount immediately, then collect payment directly from your customers. Therefore, for those businesses an invoice factoring program would make the most sense so they may receive quick access to funds to meet those business needs. Apply Now ! Asset Based Financing Asset-based loans allow a company to access working capital through a loan secured by the company's assets. This means that in this type of loan, the lender is secured by the assets (or multiple assets) held by the borrower of the business. Ultimately, this allows for lower interest rates, as this type of financing is considered less risky than unsecured loans. It is important to note that the more liquid a business asset is, the lower the risk of a loan and the lower interest rates may be. Apply Now !

Save Money On Your Investments Cost Segregation It is important to know what goes into Cost Segregation Studies. Engineering-Based Cost Segregation is the IRS-approved method for accelerating building depreciation for commercial and residential rental properties. A proper Engineering-Based Cost Segregation study identifies what should be correctly classified as tangible personal property or land improvements rather than real property, depreciated over 39 years (or 27.5 years for residential rental property). This means that all types of investment properties may qualify for a cost segregation study. Our Cost Segregation Process A High Level Overview We send you a proposal, and you approve it. We gather information on the property. A cost segregation specialist will conduct a site visit. We do all take-offs and costing. We assemble and deliver the final detailed report. Engineering-Based Vs. Residual Studies Our engineering-based cost segregation studies are far better than the residual studies most other companies perform. See What Makes Us Different! We go the extra mile for our clients by providing complete detail for both the short-life and long-life building components. This offers multiple benefits: It allows for the reconciliation of all project costs, as required by the IRS, keeping you safe in the event of an audit. It gives our clients and tax professionals the ability to track and retire short and long-life building components that are removed from service. Your tax benefits begin in the first tax year and continue throughout the identified assets depreciable life. As long as you own your property, an M&E Cost Segregation Study will continue to provide tax benefits every time a building component is replaced/taken out of service. Find Out How You Can Save on Your Taxes With M&E Cost Segregation Get a no-cost, no-obligation estimate to start your cost segregation study journey! Request a Proposal Our Engineers have completed thousands of cost segregation studies in countless situations. New Acquisition Studies/Purchase Price Allocations Suppose you recently purchased or are planning to purchase an existing property. In that case, we can help make your new acquisition more affordable by conducting an Engineering Based Cost Segregation study for the property. This will enable specific building components to be reclassified as tangible personal property or land improvements that can be depreciated over 5, 7, or 15 years rather than real property that is depreciated over 39 years (27.5 years for residential rental property). Due to the shorter recovery periods and accelerated depreciation methods, items reclassified as tangible personal property and land improvements generate faster depreciation write-offs, thus increasing your cash flow. Our Cost Segregation experts will also assign a depreciable life and a project cost to every component within the property. This will give you the ability to write off short and long-life assets that are retired in the years following the study. New Construction Studies No matter what phase you are at with your new construction project, it is beneficial to conduct an Engineering-Based Cost Segregation Study to minimize taxes and maximize ROI. Contact us today. Look-Back Studies Even if you purchased your property several years ago, you still have the ability to conduct a cost segregation study and receive the benefits of your investment in the current tax year. It can be greatly beneficial if you have owned the property for ten years or less. Leasehold Improvement Studies An Engineering Based Cost Segregation Study can be incredibly beneficial if you lease your space but have made leasehold improvements of $500,000 or more (or plan to in the future). M&E Cost Segregation can conduct an initial evaluation based on some basic information and prepare a cost vs. benefit analysis to lay out the expected tax benefits and the fixed fees required to complete the study. Then you can make an educated decision on whether to go forward with the analysis. Have You Replaced Any Structural Components of Your Building? If so, you could substantially benefit from an Asset Retirement Study.

The Veritae Way - Work Hard, Be Nice, Earn Trust Veritae - \"Truth\" Learn More - Contact Us Client Services Veritae Group Menu Client Services Veritae Group provides high-end, high-quality accounting & finance professionals for interim executive staffing and project services. Our clients call us first in the following scenarios: Interim Executive Staffing: Your CFO or Controller position is open and you don t have the capacity to absorb the work. Many companies have an internal person step in to fill the position who then becomes disillusioned when they are not selected as the final candidate. Your finance team lead has a medical leave. Organizations tend to spread the work around, creating stress on the organization and on the individual on leave. Call Veritae for a seasoned accounting or finance executive to manage daily responsibilities while you execute a thoughtful hire or need additional coverage through a medical leave. Project Services: You are acquiring a company and have not done this before. Your CPA firm can t help with the accounting for the transaction, as it is a conflict of interest. You are experiencing rapid growth. Your CFO or Controller may not have the experience to handle some of the financing issues of expansion. You are building a new facility and moving the company a new venture for your organization. You are installing new software and you need a Project Lead to manage the selection and implementation. You are undertaking a revenue recognition review in preparation for new guidance issued by the FASB and IASB, and need a seasoned person to manage and lead the project. Call Veritae for a senior level Project Manager or seasoned GAAP expert to mentor and lead your staff, adding depth and knowledge during important transitions. Giving Philosophy Veritae Group Menu Veritae s Giving Philosophy Veritae embraces the \"Go Giver\" business model - \"start by giving and success will follow\" (Burg & Mann). Simply put, it's not so much what we do but how we do it that differentiates us...such as: Giving one third of our operating profits back to our consultants and local charities, an annual commitment. Making investments in people, not brick and mortar, passing along savings to clients through lower than average mark-ups . Openly sharing our network to those in transition, at no cost to clients should they hire our referral. Retaining loyal, top notch talent by offering unique benefits - such as SIMPLE IRA with maximum match, loyalty bonuses, charitable matching, access to season tickets, and above market pay. Ranking #1 Best Places to Work in our category, by MSPBJ in 2016, our first year in the Twin Cities. Building community through involvement with numerous Boards, charitable focused events and networking forums with executive leaders and peers. Thanks to you, and others like you, who appreciate a \"people focused\" approach, we are growing faster than we ever expected.

CAO Testimonials from Veritae Consulting Partners: Nearly every company says that people are their most important resource, but Veritae is the only company I have worked for that really puts it into practice There truly is a Veritae difference, and it's noticeable in the workplace, too. I've sat amongst client staff and leaders that were cold call solicited by our competitors. The impression was rarely positive. Stay true to your compass! You've successfully separated yourselves from the competition by choosing to approach the market differently. Veritae allows me to have the flexibility to take the projects I want in the locations I want and allows me to take time off as needed to achieve a work life balance which I did not have in my previous company. Sr. management at Veritae really cares about their employees and go out of their way to let us know how valuable we are to them. Veritae truly cares about the person -- we are not just employees. They have great connections and resources to ensure that the right employee is placed at the right client. Our common goal is to help the client - the business is truly relationship focused. Testimonials on Veritae s Impact on Community: You two do such a great job of building community. Thank you! CFO Thanks for a fun night! What a wonderful cause [U of M Masonic Children s Hospital Movie Night Event] and great way to connect with our Veritae peers and their families.

Sally's career reveals a diverse blend of executive roles. While External Reporting Manager at Graco, she discovered an interest in cost accounting leading to a demanding role as a Factory Manager.

Accounting As you focus on the operations of your business, it can be difficult to also keep focus on the details of accounting. Do you find yourself not having time to reconcile your bank accounts? Perhaps you have tried to reconcile your accounts, but just can t seem to get the numbers to balance. Are you receiving all expected payments from your customers? Do you have difficulty tracking your accounts receivable and accounts payment accounts? Perhaps you have been so focused on business operations that you haven t updated accounting records at all.

Bookkeeping As a business owner, you have a lot on your plate. Your most important goal each day is to ensure the business is operating effectively. We understand that this focus on operations can take your attention away from accounting matters. It s not unusual for a start-up or small business to lack expertise in this area, making the task even more challenging. However, it is critically important to ensure your bookkeeping and accounting records are accurate, from day one of business. Some entities are required to comply with certain accounting standards and principles. Failure to do so can result in costly errors and, in some cases, a lack of compliance with federal regulations. In addition, a failure to prepare and update accounting records can put the business at risk for the occurrence of fraud. Bookkeeping Services We provide full scale bookkeeping and accounting services to our clients. A few of these services are noted below. Custom Accounting Reports Often, owners and other stakeholders need to see financial and accounting information in a format outside the typical financial statements. We can provide custom reports to facilitate management decision-making. The reports are only as accurate as the data entered. This emphasizes the importance of account reconciliation noted above. Bank Account & General Ledger Reconciliations We will perform reconciliations of your bank accounts and general",

Click here to go directly to the contact form What People Are Saying Client Reviews My experience with Justin Sundberg started a couple of years ago when I needed an Estate Tax return done in a time crunch situation. With very short notice, Justin was able to have it done prior to the needed date. Since that time I ve discuss business situations/the tax implications thereof with Justin and had tax returns, both personal and estate, done by him. I like the fact that he does his research well, if there is any question and/or options available, he takes the time and effort to verify the correct options and then fully explain them to you. Justin has the skill of listening, a skill that I ve found not all accountants have, and a trait that I find critical if one is going to discuss complicated financial matters. I ve found Justin reliable, thoughtful, timely, accurate and very professional as I trust you will also. | Source George E. | Executive & Venture Capitalist (but a private person, so off the grid) Justin has been such a godsend. Between starting a small business in 2009 and getting married, my tax situation was complicated. He found errors on my 2009 return, amended it, AND found a way to accelerate some overhead expenses to increase my deductions. He has saved me and my husband a LOT of money and is always looking for ways that I can improve my bookkeeping. I also like his paperless capabilities, as we can send tax documents electronically and securely. If you want a responsive, well-qualified CPA who provides high quality work for a fair price, call Justin! | Source Dr. Barb Kaiser | Doctor of chiropractic, focused on neurospinal correction Working with Justin is always an informative experience. He is committed to sharing his knowledge, money-saving business tips, and expertise as a way of supporting his clients, prospective clients, and his peers. In an otherwise \"dry\" field of work, Justin has a way of providing tough information in a light, fun way. I enjoy Justin's professionalism and depend on his deep knowledge of the tax system. | Source KimAileen White, MA | HR Support | Customized Outplacement | Job Transition Justin is my go-to CPA for start-up and small business needs. He should be yours as well. Justin is as personable as he is professional. I recommend Justin to friends and family without hesitation. | Source David J. Holt | Healthcare & Business Attorney | Patient Advocate | Entrepreneur | Cofounder at miVoyce.com Justin Sundberg, at Sundberg Tax and Consulting, provides excellent professional services. I have been impressed with Justin's depth of expertise and knowledge regarding small business finances and tax preparation. Furthermore, Justin combines that expertise with his strong drive for customer service and warm people skills. As a client, Justin built my knowledge-base, put me at ease, and gave me clear directions and responses to quickly address complicated issues. Justin's top notch service, genuine and kind personality and his work ethic have earned my loyalty and my recommendation. | Source Jo Miller, GPC, CSMS | Grant Professional Certified - Federal Grants and Nonprofit Consultant We hired Justin to help with our business Taxes last year and Justin brought a wealth of experience to the table. He was extremely responsive about all our questions, took his time to understand our needs, and made a huge effort to make sure we were happy with the process. We highly recommend his work and will continue to use his services! | Source Fuyei Xaykaothao | Associate Director of Programming Development and Partnerships at Saint Paul Urban Tennis Justin is a fantastic accountant who has taken so much stress out of running my own business. I rely on him for sound accounting advice and direction. He's incredibly knowledgeable and trustworthy. And he's fun to work with - how often do you hear that about an accountant?? HIGHLY recommend him! | Source Jennifer Dunn | Experienced Realtor and Public Policy Consultant/Researcher I was referred to Justin to help settle an IRS dispute. Hiring him has paid dividends over and over. Not only did he save me 50% on the five digit tax bill, but he also reviewed and cleaned up all my previous years returns, restructured my business to an S-Corp, and now he takes care of my book keeping and payroll. Justin listens to your needs and goals and is knowledgeable and a wide variety of business and tax topics.

Michael D'Amato , CPA LinkedIn Recommendation Michael and Alto CPA Group, LLC. has provided Virtual accounting, tax, and cloud solution consulting to my Arizona based business for almost 1 year and I have been consistently impressed with Michael's attitude, productivity, and advice during this time. Michael is both very bright and motivated to provide value and has gone beyond providing the minimum amount of work. Michael has a clever way of streamlining processes and finds alternative ways to drive increased efficiencies. Although my business has grown over 70% over the previous year, Michael played an instrumental role in increasing my margin rate through leveraging techniques I could never have imagined pulling off, especially with so much growth in revenue. Michael helped manage almost every P&L item and also cut the average # of days on outstanding receivables with a unique way of analyzing payment patterns by individual customers rather than days outstanding across all customers. I would recommend Michael and Alto CPA Group, LLC. to any business no matter what type of work you are looking for. Nathaniel Seeley - Owner of BlueSoft Websites, Arizona Michael D'Amato , CPA LinkedIn Recommendation I had the privilege of working with Michael while at The Children s Place. I saw Michael grow as fast as the company grew, always providing support and great data for senior management to run the business. Michael committed countless hours, was always there when we needed him, bringing enthusiasm and a unique critical eye to the business. He consistently took on new challenges and it was evident Michael had a deep understanding of the business and used his analytical and technical skills to support the business. Michael s knowledge, skills, dedication, tireless work ethic was valued by myself and the entire senior management team. I hold Michael among the best I have ever worked with. Mario Ciampi - Founder and managing partner at MCII Advisors LLC Michael D'Amato , CPA LinkedIn Recommendation It is with great pleasure I make this recommendation for Michael D Amato.

Paired with our income tax preparation services, we provide a comprehensive approach to preserving your wealth for the future. CONTACT US TODAY CONTACT US TODAY Estate, Trust, & Will Planning What is an Estate? All the property that a person owns is part of his or her estate. Your estate includes everything you own, less all of your liabilities. An estate can include a house, the land the house is built on, cash, bank accounts, retirement accounts, stocks, bonds, clothes, jewelry, tools, cars, musical instruments, and other items. What is Estate Planning? The American Bar Association defines Estate Planning as: A process involving the counsel of professional advisors who are familiar with your goals and concerns, your assets and how they are owned, and your family structure. It can involve the services of a variety of professionals, including your lawyer, accountant, financial planner, life insurance advisor, banker and broker. Estate planning covers the transfer of property at death as well as a variety of other personal matters that may or may not involve tax planning. The core document most often associated with this process is your will. Do I need an estate plan? Many people believe that estate planning is for those who are reaching the end of their life or only after death. This cannot be further from the truth. Estate planning really begins as soon as you have an estate. While they have good intentions, some people make terrible mistakes when proper planning is not done. Some of these mistakes include leaving all of their assets to their husband or wife, improperly titling real estate, not taking advantage of the gifting rules and allowances as provided by the IRS, and not naming the correct beneficiaries on their life insurance policy. The Basics One of the first things that you should do is define your goals and choose the various professionals to assist you in gathering the information and begin to put the plan together. Estate planning is not just about what happens after you die. A good estate plan will also protect you if you become incapable of handling your own affairs. A good estate plan will let you, not the courts, keep control of your assets and decisions about your medical care when you can no longer handle your own affairs. When do you begin estate planning? Most people need to plan out their estate at some point. The only time that you can prepare and implement an estate plan is while you are alive and you are capable of entering into a contract. There's no guarantee you'll have time down the road. What is a trust? A trust is an agreement between a person that owns certain assets and another person who will take care of or administer the assets (called a trustee). The trustee would take the position of its owner and make decisions on behalf of the owner. Should a trust be part of my estate planning? The drafting of the trust document is a very important function. It should completely cover your wishes regarding distribution of your property. The trust document may be used to protect your heirs by giving them rental or purchase rights to property. It can specify the price and terms of an asset purchase. It is important to formally transfer all assets to the trust. Most assets can be transferred into the trust without adverse tax consequences, but if you have some unusual assets, you should check out the tax effects. Why are trusts created? There are many types of trusts that a person could create, each designed for a specific purpose. Estate planning is a major reason for creating trusts. Avoiding probate is another major reason to create a trust. Trusts aren t just for the wealthy There are many reasons why on",

What We Do We Support Innovation Virtual Accounting Services Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Financial Controller Bookkeeper Virtual Accounting Services Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Financial Controller Bookkeeper Scroll Professional Virtual Bookkeeper | CFO Strategies LLC (855) 732-7861 Bookkeeper The scope of a bookkeeper, whether it is an in-person or a virtual bookkeeping position, can vary widely based on the client s needs and budget. For example, what works well for an insurance brokerage company may not be a good fit for an architectural firm. Bookkeeper Responsibilities Below are some tasks that may fall within a bookkeeper s duties. Recording invoices to be paid Making payments Generating and recording sales invoices Collections Making and recording deposits Administering and processing payroll Reconciling bank statements Creating and posting journal entries for all financial transactions Filing source documents Preparing financial reports , including cash flows Filing certain tax returns, such as payroll taxes and sales tax Bookkeeping services are provided on a schedule agreed to with the client and could be on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the client s needs. All services are customized and tailored to the needs of the clients. The most successful relationship is based on regular communication, where expectations are established and met or exceeded. Bookkeeping Benefits In today s workplace, most companies work in automated environments that facilitate or enable working remotely. As such, there is a greater demand for professionals that can work remotely or virtually. A virtual bookkeeper offers the same services and benefits you would expect from a bookkeeper working on-site. The virtual bookkeeper would obtain access to the company s systems, applications, and files remotely, perform the same tasks and deliver the same reports as when working on-site. The key to success is maintaining regular communication. Ultimately, there is no difference in the benefits a company will realize from the bookkeeper. By entering an independent contractor arrangement, employers reduce payroll taxes, insurance premiums, and other costs associated with having a full-time employee on the payroll. Many businesses need for a bookkeeper can be cyclical, so this arrangement can allow the business to ramp up the bookkeeper s workload during busy times and ease off during slower times. Further, it is common these days for staff to turn over frequently, often within 1-3 years, which is disruptive to an organization. Engaging an outside firm like CFO Strategies to handle your bookkeeping protects your company against staff turnover and the disruption and cost of starting over with a new bookkeeper. From the virtual bookkeeper s perspective, this structure can allow them to serve multiple companies anywhere in the country, giving them more knowledge of various systems and practices. Outsourcing your bookkeeping needs can provide a level of expertise that can otherwise be hard to get. Virtual bookkeeping firms and bookkeepers for hire often have quite a bit of experience in many different industries. Finding someone locally who can provide that level of expertise while staying within the client s payroll budget may be a challenge. Businesses don t need to provide office space, a laptop, or other supplies to the virtual bookkeeper. Virtual bookkeepers have flexible schedules as long as specific tasks are completed by the assigned deadline. Things to Consider Before Hiring A Bookkeeper Because virtual bookkeeping requires the bookkeeper to have remote access to your business s critical financial documents, data security is essential. It may be necessary to strengthen your network firewalls and other protections before you allow your virtual bookkeeper access to this sensitive information. You may also require the bookkeeper to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). This provides your organization with some protection against the disclosure of its private data. The average annual income for bookkeepers is approximately $60,000 . This can vary based on location, the volume and complexity of transactions, and the bookkeeper s experience. If this figure is well beyond your organization s budget, it may be worthwhile to look into ",

Socials: bottom of page Finding A Good Accountant | Staten Island NY | Marocola Elite Solutions Inc top of page Finding a Good Accountant Who Understands Your Business While there is no shortage of accountants in the world, not all accountants are created equal. Every business is different, and you need to be sure that your accountant properly understands the needs of your business if you want to be successful. Outsourcing your bookkeeping is a big risk. You can t do everything by yourself and at some point, you ll likely need a professional to manage your books so you can focus on more important matters. But you can trust just anyone with that responsibility. Here are a few tips on finding a good accountant who will help you succeed: Find an accountant who understands your industry: Every industry is different and not all accountants are fit to understand the nuances of every business. An accountant with experience primarily in real estate may not be the best to handle a restaurant and vice versa. It s important to look for a tax professional with experience in your industry or at least an understanding of what is needed. Find an accountant who understands your tax needs: No two businesses are the same and to find a good accountant you ll have to know what kinds of tax services you need. If you are a company with 50 employees, you will need an accountant who understands payroll tax. If you re a solopreneur who travels extensively, you will need someone adept at tracking expenses and calculating possible deductions. You will likely need a variety of services from your accountant and it s best to have a handle on what you need before seeking out a professional. Find an accountant you trust on a personal level: You don t have to be best friends, but it s important to find an accountant you feel you can trust. You should at very least have a good report with your CPA because you ll be communicating with them a lot. If you have to grit your teeth every time you make a phone call, it s wise to look for someone else. Finding a good accountant when outsourcing your bookkeeping is tough, but not impossible. Give us a call at Marocola Elite Solutions if you want to expedite the process and book a consultation with a team of accountants who will check all these boxes. bottom of page Small Business Accountant Near Me | Staten Island NY | Marocola Elite Solutions top of page Small Business Accountant Near Me The Best Small Business Accountant Near You Proper accounting is vital to the success of any business.
