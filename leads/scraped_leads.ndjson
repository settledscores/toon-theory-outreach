  "email 1": "Hey Vanessa,\n\nI came across On The Go HR recently and thought I’d drop you a quick note.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think On The Go HR could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Showing how contingency recruitment services work for time-sensitive hiring needs\n• Walking through the onboarding process for new hires\n• Explaining the benefits of personalized job seeker support\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to share a quick demo built around something On The Go HR offers. Just a sketch or script; no pressure, no pitch; just curious to see what it might sound like in your voice.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring. In the meantime, you can view a few past projects via the link in my signature.\n\nThanks for putting something refreshing out there.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 2": "Good day Vanessa,\n\nI wanted to briefly follow up to see if the idea of a quick, low-lift sketch might interest you.\n\nThese kinds of animations are used to clarify big-picture strategies, improve training content, or explain services in a more human way.\n\nIf On The Go HR has something complex or critical to explain, I’d love to put together a sample to show what it might look like.\n\nReply when ready, and check out some past examples linked below.\n\nRespectfully,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com",
  "email 3": "Howdy Vanessa,\n\nJust one last follow-up in case you missed my previous notes. I would still be happy to sketch a teaser for On The Go HR if you are curious to see what whiteboard animation can do.\n\nIt could help simplify one of your key offerings or assist with your latest project launch.

We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nFor Sanguine Strategic Advisors, I think there could be a great opportunity to use visual storytelling to help more people “get it” faster. Our animations are fully done-for-you: script, illustrations, voice, and storyboard; so you can use them for:\n\n• Showing how to optimize marketing budgets for maximum ROI\n• Demonstrating how to increase online visibility through social media\n• Explaining the benefits of SEO for small business owners\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nI’d love to put together a quick concept; maybe a script or a short teaser; around one of your key offerings. No strings, just a preview of what's possible with Sanguine Strategic Advisors's voice behind it.\n\nIf you’re curious about what this might look like, just reach out.

We’ll take care of the full creative lift: script, voice, and illustrations, so you can use it for:\n\n• Demonstrating how to select the right retail channels for a brand\n• Walking through the process of developing a successful business strategy\n• Explaining the benefits of customized branding and packaging\n\nWhether it’s more signups, better retention, or faster understanding, these animations know how to hit hard. And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nI'd be happy to draft a ten-second demo around something core to your brand. Totally low-lift, just keen to explore what this could look like with ROI's voice behind it.\n\nYou’ll find a link to our site in my signature if you’d like to see a few examples.

It’s perfect for B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think My HR Professionals could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Showing how payroll services auto-handle IRS compliance for small office teams\n• Explaining how HR solutions reduce hiring risk by 3 months\n• Visualizing benefits administration as a one-stop-shop for employee perks and support\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nI’d be glad to pull together a short demo; maybe a script or quick sketch; based on what My HR Professionals does best. No pressure, just a chance to preview what it might look and sound like.\n\nIf you're open to chatting more, just hit reply.

Nothing formal. Just something you can react to, no strings or expectations.\n\nYou’ll find a link to our site in my signature if you’d like to see a few examples.

And they move the needle where it counts.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to share a quick demo built around something 1st Accounting and Tax Services offers. Just a sketch or script; no pressure, no pitch; just curious to see what it might sound like in your voice.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring.
