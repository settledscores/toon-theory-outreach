And if you’re not interested, just reply “NO”.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",
  "email 3": "Hi Stephen,\n\nI hope your week is going well. I am wrapping up some projects and wanted to reach out again before I close things out.\n\nIf you would still like to explore using whiteboard videos to support SF Tax and Advisory Services's messaging, I would love to help. Simply reply or take a peek at some of our previous work. It is in my signature.\n\nSincerely,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nHelping you teach, pitch, and persuade in under two minutes.",
