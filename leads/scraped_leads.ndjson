Get started Landlords, retire and minimize taxes. Get Started Want more information? Watch our most recent live webinar. Flock | How it works Here's how Flock makes it work. The 721 exchange, made accessible to landlords. Section 721 of the US Internal Revenue Code ( the 721 exchange ) is a tax strategy that has been used by Wall Street investors since the 1950s. Flock Homes is the first to bring it to individual investors. With Flock, landlords can use the 721 exchange to seamlessly exchange their rental properties, tax-free, for direct ownership in a residential real estate fund. What is the process?

Get a free, no-obligation valuation on your properties, and discuss with one of our experienced Single Family Rental Directors whether Flock is the right fit for you. STEP 2 Perform due diligence. We ll provide you resources, such as fund financials and reference calls with current investors, to vet us. In parallel, we ll conduct a home inspection to lock in your valuation.

Overview About Flock Homes Compare & Contrast Flock's Portfolio Transaction Process Client Experience Overview What is Flock Homes? Founded in 2020, Flock Homes is a real estate company and fund operator empowering landlords to exit from their rental properties through the 721 exchange. Through Flock Homes, real estate investors can use the 721 exchange to exchange their single-family, duplex, triplex, or quadplex rental properties for ownership in Flock s fund without triggering capital gains taxes. While in Flock s fund, investors benefit from continued access to steady cash flow and residential real estate appreciation, without any responsibilities of managing rental properties. Where did the 721 exchange originate? 721 exchange refers to Section 721 of the US Internal Revenue Code, the same tax code that stipulates the commonly utilized Section 1031 (also known as the 1031 exchange). Section 721 was established in 1954 and has been used for decades by institutional investors to minimize taxes on real estate. Flock Homes has pioneered a platform that empowers individual landlords to access the same benefits of the 721 exchange. See our How It Works page for more details. Once I join Flock, do I still own my home? No. Once you join Flock, title of your homes is transferred over to the fund and you now own equity in Flock s diversified fund. As a result, you retain all of the benefits of real estate ownership, including access to cash flow and appreciation potential. However, you do not hold liability for managing any singular home. What kind of homes can I contribute to the Flock fund? Flock s fund accepts single-family, duplex, triplex, and fourplex rental homes. All rental homes that join Flock s fund must meet our financial return requirements. Homes with lower mortgage balances (generally, less than 50% of the home s value) are more likely to be accepted into the fund. To see if yours qualifies, click here to submit your rental home for an evaluation and our team will connect with you to discuss your valuation. How do I earn as a client of Flock s fund? With your ownership in Flock s fund, you have the ability to access cash flow from the rental income collected from the fund's portfolio of homes, and you continue benefitting from potential real estate appreciation based on the price performance of the homes in Flock's fund. You also transition into a fully passive approach to real estate investing, which has given Flock clients back countless hours of time and invaluable peace of mind. All operations of the homes in Flock s fund, including leasing, repairs, and even HOA payments are fully managed by our team of professionals. How does Flock help me minimize my taxes? The 721 exchange allows you to defer substantial capital gains and depreciation recapture taxes you might otherwise trigger in a traditional sale of property. Following the minimum hold period, you can also access greater cash flow quarterly and better control your tax liability by liquidating Flock equity over time. Finally, Flock equity also benefits from a step-up in tax basis upon inheritance ( read this for a detailed explanation on the step-up in basis ), which can provide your heirs significant tax savings when they choose to liquidate their equity. We recommend you consult with your tax advisor, attorney, and/or the IRS website to understand how Flock can complement your personalized tax planning. About Flock Homes What is the relationship between Flock Homes and Flock s fund? Flock Homes is the General Partner of Flock s fund (Flock Homes OP LP). In other words, Flock Homes acts as the manager of the fund, which is collectively owned by all of the investors who have contributed homes to the fund. What experience does the Flock Homes team have? The Flock Homes team encompasses decades of investment and management experience from the largest real estate institutions in the world, including J.P. Morgan, State Street Global Advisors, and Progress Residential, and has used their expertise to help 150+ landlords retire from real estate through Flock Homes. Learn more about the team here . What happens if Flock Homes goes bankrupt? Flock Homes, our company and General Partner of the Fund, is an independent entity separate from the Flock Fund, which holds the high-quality, income-generating assets collectively owned by clients (or, Limited Partners). This structure ensures that the Fund can continue operating as long as a fund administrator is in place. In the unlikely event that Flock Homes goes bankrupt, and to future-proof client wealth, Flock has entered into an agreement with Roofstock, a leading single-family rental (SFR) platform that manages 25,000+ homes across 35+ markets, to act as a standby servicer to the Fund. While Roofstock is not formally responsible for management today and does not have any management authority, Flock s arrangement engages Roofstock to become versed in the Fund s operations and assets, including the Fund s tax-driven execution and administration of 721 Exchanges. In the event there is a need to transition management of the Fund from Flock, Roofstock will, subject to the requisite approvals, be in a position to seamlessly integrate into the role of Fund Manager. What is Flock s historical performance? Flock has met or exceeded its cash return target to investors every quarter since inception. You can see our most recent Quarterly Fact Sheet for detailed performance figures here. Is Flock registered with the SEC? Yes. While Flock's Fund is not currently subject to full SEC registration requirements due to an applicable exemption, Flock is nevertheless regulated by the SEC and subject to the rules for private fund advisors. Flock also files a Form D annually. You can find our filings on the SEC s website . Compare & Contrast What is the difference between the 721 exchange and the 1031 exchange? Many real estate investors utilize the 1031 exchange to sell their home for proceeds, and use those proceeds, tax-deferred, to purchase other investment real estate. With Flock Homes, investors can use the 721 exchange to seamlessly exchange their homes, tax-deferred, for direct ownership in Flock s managed real estate fund. With a 1031 exchange, investors commonly continue to",

The issues involved in healthcare valuation are driven by a complex regulatory environment, highly varied reimbursement models, and unique operating structures. Failure to understand these details can have a huge financial impact, and we believe our clients deserve valuation advisors who are laser-focused on this space. Call (888) 464-8175 or contact us online today. Healthcare Business Valuation Services Business valuation determines the overall economic value of an organization or its specific assets. This process employs methodologies like the income approach (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis), market approach (examining comparable transactions), or asset-based approach. Key factors influencing business valuation in healthcare include: Revenue streams Payer mix Operational efficiency Regulatory compliance Market competitiveness For instance, a valuation might assess how hospital-specific metrics such as bed utilization rates and specialty services influence profitability and overall worth. Your goals matter to us. At Root Partners, we work directly with our clients valuation needs to ensure their business transactions run as smoothly as possible.

Continue Reading Read Less Do What's Right We believe in honesty and integrity, stewardship and accountability to our clients, our staff, and the communities we serve. Solution-Oriented We help clients find objective, defensible solutions for transactions and financial arrangements involving the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute. Constant Learning We maintain deep expertise through ongoing education, research, and active involvement in healthcare trade organizations. People First We prioritize the human element in everything we do, acting with kindness, respect, and appreciation in our interactions. Compensation Valuation Services Compensation valuation assesses whether a healthcare provider's pay aligns with FMV and commercial reasonableness. This is often essential for compliance with laws such as the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute, which regulate financial relationships between providers and referral sources. Compensation valuation analyzes provider productivity data, regional benchmarks, and industry standards. It involves metrics like total work relative value units (wRVUs) for physicians, collections, and hours worked. For example, ensuring a physician s salary for a medical director role complies with FMV helps safeguard against legal risks and promotes ethical practices. Defensible Solutions for Evolving Compensation Models Aligning physicians and other healthcare providers is vital to the success of healthcare organizations. With an ever-changing regulatory landscape and constantly evolving compensation models, it is critical to support compensation arrangements with well-reasoned, defensible, and actionable fair market value (FMV) opinions. At Root Partners we don t provide canned opinions or survey-based calculators. Instead, we work diligently to understand our client s alignment goals, the regulatory guardrails pertinent to the arrangement, and the true market-based value drivers underpinning the compensation arrangement. Most importantly, we work collaboratively to educate all parties involved to build consensus and facilitate a successful and compliant outcome. Fair Market Value in Clinical Compensation In an ever-changing regulatory and competitive environment, clinical compensation models should be continually evaluated to remain attractive to providers, commercially reasonable, and compliant. Root Partners does not take a one-size-fits-all approach to clinical compensation. Instead, we consider both quantitative and qualitative measures that truly drive fair market value. Clinical compensation engagements include : Physician and APP employment Professional services agreements (PSAs) Subsidies and stipends Call coverage Medical directorships Administrative Compensation Strategic alignment across the healthcare continuum is a driving force behind improved outcomes and reductions in the cost of care. With the ongoing evolution of payor models, value based enterprises, healthcare technologies, and novel services models, the need for innovative and dynamic valuation models has never been greater. At Root Partners , we pride ourselves on being a solution-driven appraisal firm providing defensible and well-reasoned FMV opinions across an ever-changing landscape of administrative pay models. Examples include: Physician executive and administrative pay Pay for performance and value-based compensation Management services agreements (MSAs) Clinical co-management and hospital quality and efficiency programs (HQEP) Care coordination and management Healthcare technology platforms / novel care delivery models Compliance Testing and Appraisal Review: Ongoing Support and Validation Keeping your compensation models consistent with FMV is an ongoing process. Root Partners is here to help, with ongoing testing and review processes that can help your organization proactively monitor compensation. Our objective is to ensure compliance before a problem arises. If your organization has received a healthcare valuation that doesn t quite seem right, we are here to personally review all the information and critique previous work. We want you to have a clear understanding of our opinion on the appraisal and our suggestions for your next steps. We work with clients across the United States from California to Texas to Florida who need a sound valuation of their practice.

Given these concerns, markets have fallen, with the S&P 500 dropping more than 10% from its highs and into correction territory. The market declines can be unsettling; however from a planning perspective, declines in asset values can also present opportunities to employ planning strategies that could better position you and your financial strategy for long-term success. These strategies can be particularly beneficial for higher-net-worth individuals or those with potentially taxable estates, as they can help mitigate future estate or income taxes. Below we outline several planning strategies that may help you take advantage of these declines and turn your strategy from defense to offense. Gifting and Estate Tax Planning: If you intend to pass your assets to individual beneficiaries and you may be subject to estate tax, there are a number of strategies that could be particularly beneficial during a down market. In 2025, the annual gift exclusion is $19,000 per donee per donor, and the federal lifetime estate and gift tax exemption is $13.99 million per individual. Expectations are that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) will be extended in full or in part, but if no changes are made, the lifetime exemption will sunset at the end of 2025, meaning the exemption would fall from $13.99 to approximately $7 million, adjusted for inflation. Thus, some gifting* and estate-planning strategies could be particularly valuable and timely during a down market, allowing you to transfer assets when values are down, helping maximize the value of your gift and potentially reducing future estate taxes. This would include the following strategies: Gifting : Consider making gifts to individuals (or certain trusts for their benefit) up to the annual exclusion limit. And if you intend to use part or all of your gift tax exemption during your life, you may want to evaluate whether a down market may present an efficient time for such a gift. Transferring assets when values are down could allow you to either transfer more shares of investments within the annual exclusion amount or use less lifetime exemption for the gift. Trust Strategies : Similar to the gifting strategy, transferring assets to an irrevocable trust when asset values are down could allow you to transfer more shares/assets or use less of your lifetime exemption, while still removing the future appreciation of those assets from your estate. These strategies are most beneficial for individuals who have federal or state estate tax concerns and are interested in gifting assets to individual beneficiaries. Strategies including intentionally defective grantor trusts (IDGTs), spousal lifetime access trusts (SLATs), and grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs) present planning opportunities for assets with decreased values. Funding IDGTs and SLATs during a market downturn allows for more efficient use of your lifetime exemption. A GRAT would be primarily for individuals who anticipate federal estate tax liability and are interested in mitigating it by removing the appreciation of particular assets from their taxable estate. For example, if you have securities that have high growth potential, transferring them to a GRAT when asset values are down could remove some of the appreciation (and tax liability) from your estate during a recovery. However, assets that depreciate over the GRAT's term or assets without much growth are not efficient choices for funding, so this strategy requires careful consideration of the assets used to fund the GRAT. And if you plan to transfer assets to more remote generations, such as grandchildren, consider making those gifts using your generation skipping transfer (GST) tax exemption during the down market to help optimize your exemption allocation. Additional Tax-Planning Considerations: In addition to the estate-planning strategies above, there are additional strategies you could consider during a down market that could help with taxes and tax planning. Roth Conversions: When you convert assets from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, you pay income taxes on the value of the assets being converted, so it's important to note that a Roth conversion will result in an increase in taxes. That said, performing a Roth conversion when asset prices are depressed could reduce the amount you have to pay in taxes, as you would be converting a lower portfolio value. This could then provide an opportunity for tax-free growth in your Roth as asset values recover. Tax Loss Harvesting: While many people think about tax loss harvesting as something you do at the end of the year (when your overall tax liability may be clearer), you can tax loss harvest at any time. Recognizing capital losses could allow you to offset capital gains recognized throughout the year. Any excess capital losses are next used to reduce ordinary income by up to $3,000, with any remaining excess losses carried into future years to offset capital gains recognized in 2026 or later. This can also be a great opportunity if you find yourself needing to rebalance your portfolio. Taking Control of Your Strategy While none of us enjoy periods of market volatility, these fluctuations are a normal part of investing, and they can be used as an opportunity to better position your financial strategy for long-term success. Talk to your professional team, including your financial advisor, tax and legal professionals to see if the above strategies make sense for your situation. *Consult your tax professional before gifting assets with values below your cost basis, as it may be more efficient to recognize the loss before making the gift. Edward Jones, its employees and financial advisors cannot provide tax or legal advice. You should consult your attorney or qualified tax advisor regarding your situation.

I created BSFG, a Public Benefit Company, in order to use my bookkeeping expertise, vetted procedures, and strategy oriented brain to support business owners to be more powerful change-agents in their target areas. I have a strong clean-up background and have proficiently turned messy books into clean, fully reconciled, better organized and easily readable financial statements for businesses including: legal, dental, med-spas, research & development tech start-ups, cleaning companies, e-commerce, food-trucks, trucking/logistics, non-profits, farms, flower shops, Real-Estate and Title companies, Design & Consultation firms, Landscaping and Home Services, Yoga, Art Studios, and more. I take pride in thoroughly documented and demonstrated journal entries, reconciliations, and workpapers so that all elements of your financials are proven and tie-back to source documentation. What this means for you is that there's concrete evidence for trusting your financials; and that our frequent conversations about your trajectories and landscape are heavily informed by my experience with other businesses' financials, which means you're not in it alone. We can implement best practices for almost any situation (examples: scope of work profitability tracking, payroll growth forecasting, grant-mapping) and we work from reports that speak about your business in the language you already think of it in.

Not everyone has the vision and drive required to successfully take a concept and bring it to life. And the thought of hiring external staff, like a bookkeeper, can feel a bit daunting. Early on, when you re just starting out, it s manageable to track everything yourself or use basic software. But as your business grows, you might find that managing all those invoices, payments, and expenses becomes overwhelming, explains Steven Kibbel, certified financial planner and founder of Kibbel Financial . I ve seen small business owners who wait too long to address this and end up with errors in their books, missing payments to vendors, or even misreporting revenue. SEE ALSO: The 20 best tools for starting your own business Sure, you might pride yourself on running a lean business, but a good bookkeeper should be seen as an investment, one that helps you track and retain more of your hard-earned money and frees up your time to focus on what you re best at. If you ve been wondering whether or not you need outside help to track and manage your small business expenses and income, you ll want to read on. Here are the tell-tale signs that it might be time to hire a bookkeeper, according to a certified financial planner and a small business tax advisor. 1. When you re unable to keep track of the inflow and outflow of cash As your business grows, managing your own books can quickly become overwhelming. You might lose track of who owes you money, miss vendor invoice deadlines, and struggle to accurately track cash flow, says Alex Cook, VP of Small Business Tax at Block Advisor . Reliable cash flow management is crucial for making informed business decisions that ensure long-term success. However, if bookkeeping isn't your strength, it can hinder your progress. According to Cook, untangling financial messes on your own can consume valuable time that could be better spent on sales and revenue generation. If this sounds familiar, it might be time to outsource your accounting to a trusted provider. 2. When bookkeeping starts eating into your time Another big trigger is when bookkeeping starts eating into the time you should be spending on running and growing your business. I worked with a client who owned a small retail shop, and she told me she was staying up until midnight every night trying to reconcile her accounts. That s time she could have spent sourcing new inventory or marketing her business, explains Kibbel. Hiring a book",

If something you hear sparks some interest on your part, I d love to know! Is This You? - Business Culture Consultants Is This You? I ve worked in a variety of industries, including retail, technology, hospitality, manufacturing, professional service providers, non-profit and financial institutions, and start-ups. In every engagement, I ensure we share these values: Integrity in the way business is done around finances, sales/marketing, and relationships. A recognition that there is no quick fix to changing patterns in the culture While it is important to get a sense of how the work will be done there s also a willingness to go into the unknown A sense of the business serving a higher purpose Most of my clients have the following criteria in common: FIVE TO FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES Revenues of $1.5mil or greater schedule a free consultation Commitment to a multiple bottom line business model While I customize my work for every client, there are some common scenarios I see come up again and again. Let s see if you recognize your organization in any of these Your staff is stressed out and you can t quite get to the root causes. Striking the balance between consistency and giving your employees autonomy has been hard to find. Shortly after trying solutions like offsite retreats or workshops your people fall back into old patterns. Meetings typically start late, agenda items aren t always all covered, and falling into rabbit holes is a common occurrence. You re still not where your organization should be in blending remote and in-person collaborations and cohesiveness. You are often inspired and have visions for the organization, but find your team is cynical toward new initiatives. You continuously set sales goals, only to fall short. Team members often feel stressed out, overwhelmed, and/or swept along. One of your star performers just gave notice, and you sense there is more to their story than pursuing other opportunities but aren t sure what that could be. You ve provided tons of training and online webinars, but there are still too many negative patterns of behavior. You have strong organizational values, however integrating them into everything you do still remains a challenge. Do any of these sound familiar? schedule a free consultation What I Don t Do Mandated Coaching: Coaching only works when individuals are ready for change. Just like the joke How many therapists does it take to change a lightbulb? Only one, but the lightbulb has to want to change. , clients must be self-motivated for real progress to happen. Continuing to Work Without Commitment: If leaders aren t upholding their commitments to the process, I won t continue to engage. Success requires consistent involvement and accountability from leadership, and I ve stepped away from relationships where this wasn t happening. Therapy: While my psychology background informs my work, coaching is distinct from therapy. If issues like anxiety or depression arise, I refer clients to specialized professionals, allowing us to keep our focus on organizational-related growth and transformation.

Make a Payment Client Portal Testimonials Newsletter Latest Edition Newsletter Archives Subscribe Contact Contact Request Appointment BOI Your Introduction to Green Apple Resources From the desk of Kim Perkins Founder and CEO of Green Apple Resources Thursday, 8:33am Dear business owner, If there s two things you take away from this site, let it be these: Your time is worth more than you realize. Accurate knowledge, regular review, and careful analysis of your financial situation affords you the best chance to help your business succeed on all levels. One of the many reasons small businesses fail is because of financial management issues. Most entrepreneurs don t get bookkeeping or financial help, and they pay for it in the end. By working with us, you can improve your efficiency, increase your chances of success, and concentrate on growing your business what you set out to do with your knowledge and experience in the first place. Like the fruits of any honest labor, Green Apple Resources developed from a single seed planted years ago. Then in 2004, I started a bookkeeping business called Books by the Numbers. As I worked over the years with small business owners, entrepreneurs and growing companies like my own across New Hampshire, I found their needs stretched beyond the financial realm. To meet those needs, I moved beyond Books by the Numbers to create Green Apple Resources. My vision is reflected in the new slogan, At the Core : To provide our clients with the administrative foundation necessary to run a business that not only survives, but thrives. With more than 15 years of experience across a diverse range of industries, the Green Apple mission is to provide full service bookkeeping, payroll services, office management, training and income tax preparation, with a focus on outstanding customer service. My team will work with your goals in mind (or help you create them), and do everything within our areas of expertise to help you achieve them. Thank you very much for your interest. I hope we ve made your time on this site a valuable investment. Best regards, Kim Perkins, EA P.S. We re so committed to helping business owners beat the financial management issues that put so many struggling professionals out of business, we offer a free, no obligation consultation to those ready to move forward with their vision and profits. Just contact us , and let us know when and where you d like to meet. You ve got nothing to lose, and everything to gain.

But so many small business owners become their own worst bosses! Most likely, the goal was never to work 50-80 hours per week. The Big Picture probably didn t involve you buried under To-Dos and Should ves, lost in a sea of unreconciled bank statements, unsent invoices, unfiled paperwork, and unending drudgery. It happens to virtually all entrepreneurs and small business owners about to take their success to the next level. To take the leap, you simply have to get smarter about your time and resources. Delegating. Building a team. Focusing on your high return-on-investment activities. These are the things you need to do, and you know this. But how? And more importantly, who can you trust to handle the rest? Us. For example Bookkeeping This is our core competency, and over the years we ve created systems to become more cost efficient and deliver accurate, rapid reporting.

Brian Royce Worker Royce Works, LLC 5.0 Based on 20 reviews powered by G o o g l e review us on Jack Coyne 20:54 17 Feb 25 Brian is amazing. Had a job for him right after a snow storm and he was there the same day! Fast and accurate, with honest pricing. Adam Crockett 13:55 14 Dec 24 Great experience Steven Vogl 14:42 27 Nov 24 You will never receive the level of service and attention to detail from anyone else that you will receive from Brian. And be prepared to be impressed by his progress and recap reports complete with pictures and detailed explanations. Can t go wrong! Jon C 17:51 18 Oct 24 I had a broken storm door with some rotted trim, and Brian Royce from Royceworks did an excellent job fixing everything. Not only did he install the new door perfectly, but he also cleaned up the area and replaced the old brickmold with durable, rot-free PVC molding. The new door looks exactly how I wanted, and Brian went above and beyond by taking a trip to the local hardware store to replace missing hardware from the original shipment. I really appreciated Brian's great communication throughout the process and, of course, his exceptional craftsmanship. If you're looking for someone responsive and reliable for carpentry or handyman work, I highly recommend Brian Royce! Mindy Perkins 00:02 05 Oct 24 We had a hot water tank leak, and the insulation under home needed to be replaced, as well as the underbelly. Brian was very open and upfront with the situation. He still did the job, because he said he would. He was very quick and efficient in completing the job, and came in under his initial quote. Brian went above and beyond to do the job for us, and we highly recommend him! Jessica Matt 00:27 16 Sep 24 Very dependable and showed great care in his work. He was thorough and attentive to my needs in multiple home repairs. He spent extra time making sure the job was correctly. He was always responsive in communication. If you're looking for a trustworthy carpenter, Royce Works is where to go. Andrea B 02:49 24 Jul 24 I highly recommend Brian if you need work done on your home. My mother and I called Brian after doing some research and seeing the great ratings he had. We had no idea if he'd be able to help us in general, let alone how quickly he did. We had a couple of projects that we desperetly needed to get done. First and for most for safety reasons and then because of how unappealing they were to look at. Brian called me back the same day. He then arranged a time to come the next day to speak with us and get a better idea on what was going on. He agreed to take on the projects and did so with a wonderful attitude. He also had help at times from a trusted associate (Todd) whom also was very knowledgeable and did great work. Part of one of the projects involved old wiring, updating and relocating some of that, and adding a couple power sources. Although he probably could've done it himself, he called on a trusted electrician to get the job done. So if there is something he may not feel the most comfortable doing he will tell you and he will find the proper help to do so. Then part way through one of the other projects, it ended up being more of a mess than anticipated. Despite that, Brian tried his best to stay on budget, keep our stress down, and reassured us that things will still get done as planned. Brian communicated everything thing with us the whole way through. Efficiently and professionally. He definitely takes pride in his work and is devoted in making his customers happy. He strides in making things as safe as possible; as if he were doing the work for his own family. And in making sure things look great! It is hard to trust a stranger with your property, time, and money and we have no regrets that we trusted Brian! We would definitely work with him again in the future! Alex Ebert 13:16 05 Jul 24 Thank you Royce Works for saving our aging deck. Brian went above and beyond when it came to bringing life back to our outside oasis!! Our deck was suffering from rotting infrastructure beams, and cosmetic boards and railings. He came right over, did an assessment and gave us an affordable price. Super hard worker, master carpentry skills, and super detailed. Very professional and very friendly guy. We were so pleased with his work we asked him to fix up some more projects around the house. Hope to work with you again in the near future! Thanks Brian! Jeff Zahner 11:10 29 Jun 24 Brian Royce recently rebuilt my entire deck. He originally gave me a price to just repair and replace rotted decking. After he arrived and re-evaluated he replaced every single deck board and the stairs. The work and craftsmanship was onpoint. He was clean and respectful of my property and did a fantastic job. On time and on budget. I would highly recommend his company and his services. I have several other projects that I plan on using Royce Works for. scott mcewan 17:03 09 Jun 24 Brian answered my add for construction help. He was very knowledgeable, owned all the needed tools and performed above my expectations. Would hire him again without question. Kaleigh Lewis 13:36 09 May 24 Brian and team was great! Super meticulous, went above and beyond in every way. His final report was detailed and extremely thorough, would absolutely hire him again! Kerry A. Chase 12:43 29 Apr 24 Brian did everything and more to repair a neglected porch at our rental property. Brian answered my email within hours and visited the next business day to scope out the work. He provided a detailed and clear proposal, with options and recommendations; he completed the work when he said he would; and he took tremendous care in all aspects of the job. Along the way, he was in regular communication and even sent photos. We couldn t have asked for more. Excellent work and workmanship! Cheryl Mahoney 19:48 30 Mar 24 Brian is a professional, reliable, and skilled carpenter. His work is high quality and we are very pleased with the 3 projects he has done for us. Communication was never an issue and he always got back to us quickly. We look forward to working with Brian on other projects. Lauren D 21:12 17 Feb 24 I wish I could give him 10 stars because his work is amazing and very detailed oriented! Brian is great at what he does and puts so much thought and detail into his projects! Brian helped me come up with ideas for our home I didn't even know I wanted, and they came out amazing! He is efficient and very thoughtful with his presence in our home, and around our family! I highly recommend Brian for any home improvements, tear downs, landscaping, carpentry , any home improvement I needed he was there and he has amazing woodworking skills! He has helped improve every room in our new home and couldn t thank him enough for all the hard work! He even completed jobs he doesn t advertise as work he does just because I needed help with it! Thank you Brian I can t wait for spring time so I can have you back for our new decks and landscaping!!10 Victoria Donaghy 19:39 16 Feb 24 Our 50+ year old, \"on the cheap\" garage needed a facelift. We hired Brian to install some trim, cedar shingles, remove two standard size windows and add five small cosmetic windows all to complement the house. Brian was fastidious and was satisfied with nothing short of perfection. We could not be happier with his work and will be having him reside a summer rental \"barn\" on our property as well as attend to a number of other \"aging\" issues wood homes experience. We highly recommend Brian and cannot praise the quality of his work enough. Jim Pinierio 15:06 11 Dec 23 Brian did tremendous work at my house. He completed two projects. First, was the installation of a ramp for a new shed. His attention to detail was apparent when, before the attachment, he discovered that the shed was not level.

I'm the CEO of a small, but fast growing, company, and I had previously been taking care of our multi-state payroll myself. It was overwhelming and I did not have the necessary expertise. Christina from Valor stepped in and took our payroll over completely, including all of the multi-state tax filings and other reporting. She also fixed all of the mistakes I didn't even know I had made. She is kind, gracious, knowledgeable, attentive, and communicative. She has improved my company and has allowed us to continue growing. I would recommend Valor to any company with payroll needs. You will kick yourself for not doing it sooner. Tamara D. Christina Hageny did some early work for our company and we were so impressed with her level of knowledge, expertise and commitment to the project that we signed her on to manage our company's payroll full time. We deal in all 50 states and have employees spread out all over the country. As you can imagine, we brought a pretty complex set-up to the relationship, but Christina tackled it without any issue and got us back into compliance while ensuring that our team got compensated correctly and on time along the way. We do and will continue to recommend Christina Hageny and Valor Payroll Solutions to our friends and colleagues. Capable, trustworthy and unparallel customer service! Tony G. Highly highly recommend. Valor is extremely professional and quick to answer any of my questions. I love that I have the ability to input hours and I am able to add employees easily. Christina has been patient with my many many, often times duplicate questions as I have been learning. She has helped me gain better understanding when it comes to payroll. After paying employees over 4 years I feel like I have such a better handle & understanding of payroll than I ever have. Thanks to Christina and her team. 5 stars! Whitney V. We are a virtual organization with team members located all over the United States. Christina and her team have been amazing in helping us manage payroll and compliance for multiple states.

I'm the CEO of a small, but fast growing, company, and I had previously been taking care of our multi-state payroll myself. It was overwhelming and I did not have the necessary expertise. Christina from Valor stepped in and took our payroll over completely, including all of the multi-state tax filings and other reporting. She also fixed all of the mistakes I didn't even know I had made. She is kind, gracious, knowledgeable, attentive, and communicative. She has improved my company and has allowed us to continue growing. I would recommend Valor to any company with payroll needs. You will kick yourself for not doing it sooner. Tamara D.

Accounting Services Accounting Services It s a fact: Working with a business advisor dramatically increases the odds of success for your business. And with 50% of businesses failing in their first five years (Source: SBA), it just makes good business sense to find ways to increase your chances of success with your business. Finding the Perfect Blend of Accounting Skills and Expertise Every business is different when it comes to the type and level of accounting services needed. Some small businesses may only need bookkeeping services, while others benefit from many layers of accounting skills from bookkeepers to Chief Financial Officers. If your business is in the small to mid-market range, it may not make sense to have a full-time CFO, a full-time controller, and multiple bookkeepers with all the full-time salaries and benefits in your accounting department. The good news is you can still get the advice of these high-level accounting skill sets while paying only for what you need. We work with business owners like you to create a customized package based on your company s unique accounting needs. How We Can Help Your Business Accounting System Selection Having the right accounting system can make all the difference in the world. We re familiar with many accounting software options and can help you find the best fit for your business. If you ve outgrown your current solution, we can help you manage the transition without missing a beat. One secret in boosting accounting productivity is to make sure your accounting software is set up and customized correctly. We learn your requirements so we can tailor the accounting software to your business and reporting needs. Plus, we can train your staff on the new system so they can be up and running in no time. Accounting System Selection, Setup, Customization and Training Workflow Efficiencies Streamlined data gathering and entry Process Development and Improvement The accounting function is necessary in every business, but it shouldn t be cumbersome or inefficient. We can take a look at areas within your accounting system that are costing you more than they should be. These could include areas of duplicate data entry, time spent on manual reports, and bottlenecks in general. We ll suggest improvements that can save you time and money and keep your bookkeeping bill as low as possible. Are there any areas in your accounting functions that are undocumented? We can help you write a procedures manual for those areas. Good documentation is the key to good training, consistency, and controls. Let Hughes Walker Group suggest efficiency recordkeeping workflows for some of these key elements of your business: Invoicing & sales receipts Expenses & expense reporting Payroll Accounting controls Profitability Analysis Do you wonder which product or service line is the most profitable for you? We can perform an analysis of profitability by location, product, employee, or whatever grouping is meaningful for you. This information will help you make better decisions about your revenue mix and make your business more profitable in the long term. While most accountants stick to cursory expense reviews, we prefer to go deeper. We can help you identify costs that may be outside your industry norms, discover areas where your pricing might not cover your costs, and root out profit margins that should be higher. If you maintain inventory in your business, we can help you lower carrying costs, determine out-of-stock conditions, and identify obsolete items. Is your business project-based with job costing requirements? We can help you make sure it s set up right, help you create more accurate estimates, and accelerate cash flow with timely progress billings. We go beyond traditional services by providing: Monthly financial reports (Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow) Regular business reviews (Either monthly, quarterly, or annual) Industry related key performance indicators to call attention to financial issues and inconsistencies Cash flow projections Loan package creation Budgeting and forecasting Profitability Analysis Committed to the Relationship It can be difficult to find advice when you are in business for yourself. As a fellow small business owner, we can act as a sounding board for your business ideas and provide a fresh, experienced perspective. We can serve as an unbiased listener for your ideas and concerns. There are so many benefits to hiring a bookkeeping company to take care of your books. Peace of mind Relief Better business insight Tax time is a little less taxing More profits Focus How to Get Started How to Get Started The perfect synergy between a business owner and the accounting team occurs when two things happen: 1) the team gains a deeper knowledge about your specific business, and 2) the business owner grows in their financial knowledge about their business. This is when the magic really starts to happen for the business, and it improves over time. Our goal is to become a true partner for your business by providing you with the right mix of accounting services for you and your business.

Jenna is a 3rd generation entrepreneur following in the footsteps of both her father, Chris, and grandfather, Gene. 8111 Raytown Road is where Gene planted roots for his family and his business.

Download Salary Survey Employers Guide to Managing AI in the Workplace This guide provides HR and legal considerations for employers to understand artificial intelligence (AI). Managing AI in the Workplace Our Members Include I attended the harassment prevention workshop put on by Employers Council, and I wanted to share my praise for the presenter. I was skeptical about whether I would learn anything I didn't already know, but she presented the information in thought-provoking and nuanced ways. She answered questions well and had us do an activity that enlivened the presentation. As an academic, I particularly appreciated the way that she was able to address the issues intellectually and not simply give us an \"information dump.\" Anyway, I was impressed with what I expected to be a boring presentation. - Professor, Regis University Professor - Regis University Our handbook needed to be updated. We had done minor revisions over the years, but more policies than we needed crept into the handbook over time. I wanted to keep what was important and get rid of the rest. I sent my handbook to Employers Council and staff went through all of the policies to first let me know what could be eliminated, and what needed to change in order to bring it up to date. The best thing was that this is part of my full membership dues, so there was no charge for this. I send in my handbook every one or two years for a tune up, so it reflects current laws and stays streamlined. Lynnette Siedschlaw, HR Director - Moffat County As I faced some difficult employee problems over the years, I knew that I could reach out to Employers Council and get some good solid advice in how to handle a situation. In the 20 years if have been working in HR I don t believe I was ever given bad advice. I may not have always agreed with what the counsel was, but I never put myself or the company in a compromising position by following your advice and recommendations. Joe Maylin, Human Resources Manager - Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. Being able to reach out to someone on the Member Experience Team when something comes up and we're just not sure how to handle it is amazing. We have help just a phone call or an email away, and everyone that we have worked with has been so responsive, understanding, and helpful. Sarah Swanty, Founder and Executive Director - Animal Friends Alliance Why Choose Employers Council? For a business of any size to thrive, its people need to thrive.
