  "email 1": "Hey Vanessa,\n\nI came across On The Go HR recently and thought I’d drop you a quick note.\n\nI'm Trent, and I run Toon Theory; an animation studio based in the UK. We use hand-drawn animations to help businesses get their message across. It's a simple way to cut through noise, especially in B2B, thought leadership, and data-driven education.\n\nI think On The Go HR could really benefit from using visual storytelling to explain things faster and make them stick. We take care of everything: scripting, illustration, voiceover and storyboarding; so you can use the final video for:\n\n• Showing how contingency recruitment services work for time-sensitive hiring needs\n",
  "email 2": "Walking through the onboarding process for new hires\n• Explaining the benefits of personalized job seeker support\n\nThese videos often help businesses increase engagement by up to 60%, double conversion rates, and boost message retention by up to 80%.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to share a quick demo built around something On The Go HR offers",
  "email 3": "Just a sketch or script; no pressure, no pitch; just curious to see what it might sound like in your voice.\n\nAlways open to a quick chat if this feels worth exploring. In the meantime, you can view a few past projects via the link in my signature.",
