We help businesses like your's show what they mean; especially when it’s the kind of thing that’s tricky to summarize in one sentence.\n\nI know SF Tax and Advisory Services runs a layered, solution-based operation, which is exactly what our videos are built for: simplifying complex offers into something people understand right away.If you've ever tried to put SF Tax and Advisory Services's key offerings into words and ended up with a huge wall of text, you're not alone. We help simplify it with short, clear explainers; and we handle every step in-house, so you can just hit play.\n\nMost folks use them as evergreen explainers; handy whenever someone asks *‘so what do you do?’* They can live on your homepage, pitch decks or even newsletters.\n\nIf you’re into it, I could draft a small script or storyboard to show how this might work for you.\n\nYou’re welcome to reach out if this interests you. A few examples are included in my signature; and if not your thing, a simple 'NO' will take you off my list.\n\nThanks,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",
  "email 2": "Hello Stephen,\n\nJust looping back in case this got lost in your inbox. I mentioned how whiteboard animation could support SF Tax and Advisory Services’s messaging ; and I still believe there’s a great fit here.\n\nThese videos are especially helpful when you’re trying to explain something technical, strategic, or new in a way that sticks.\n\nIf it helps, I’d be happy to put together a short script or quick teaser to show what this could look like.\n\nFeel free to reply if you’d like to explore it. You’ll find examples of our work in my signature. If it’s not a fit, feel free to reply with a quick “NO” and I won’t reach out again.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",
  "email 3": "Hey Stephen,\n\nJust reaching out again before I close this thread. If you think animated storytelling could be of value to SF Tax and Advisory Services, I would love to put something together.\n\nEven a 10-second sketch can be a useful way to explore what is possible.\n\nFeel free to reply at your convenience.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nTrusted by consultants, coaches, and businesses who care about clarity.",

We help businesses like your's show what they mean; especially when it’s the kind of thing that’s tricky to summarize in one sentence.\n\nWith so many bundled offerings and tailored services like the ones RLI Consulting provides, it’s easy for prospects to miss the point. We make videos that connect those dots instantly, and we handle everything in-house so you don't even have to lift a finger.\n\nThey’re built once, but tend to get reused in all kinds of conversations; such as your homepage, newsletters or pitch decks.\n\nAlways happy to put pen to paper. I could sketch something simple out; no strings.\n\nYou’re welcome to reach out if this interests you. A few examples are included in my signature; and if not your thing, a simple 'NO' will take you off my list.\n\nWarmly,\nTrent — Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nWhiteboard videos your customers will actually remember.",

Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nIf it takes three paragraphs to explain what you do at Tax Solutions Group, then it’s probably time for a video. We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nTeams often plug them into their homepage, newsletters, or even client onboarding kits. These videos are super dynamic.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to see how this could sound for Tax Solutions Group; happy to whip up a quick teaser, 10 seconds or so.\n\nYou can reply whenever if this seems worth exploring. There’s some past work in my signature too. Or just send 'NO' if this isn’t your thing.\n\nThanks,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nI know CFO Strategies runs a layered, solution-based operation, which is exactly what our videos are built for: simplifying complex offers into something people understand right away.If you've ever tried to put CFO Strategies's key offerings into words and ended up with a huge wall of text, you're not alone. We help simplify it with short, clear explainers; and we handle every step in-house, so you can just hit play.\n\nMost teams keep reusing them. They're really helpful on landing pages, in follow-ups, or even onboarding flows.\n\nThis might be easier to show than tell; happy to put a no-cost sample together if you’re up for it.\n\nHappy to hear from you if this caught your eye. You’ll find some examples down below if you’d like to browse; or just reply 'NO' if you’d rather not get follow-ups.\n\nKind regards,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",

Or simply reply “NO” if you'd like to opt out.\n\nRegards,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",

Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nTeams like InTANDEM Human Resources that deliver bundled, multi-layered offerings often need help showing how it all fits together. That’s what we do: clear videos that explain it all, zero lift on your side.\n\nMost folks use them as evergreen explainers; handy whenever someone asks *‘so what do you do?’* They can live on your homepage, pitch decks or even newsletters.\n\nLet me know if you want a quick visual mock; no deck, no pitch, just a sketch.\n\nIf this sparks even a bit of curiosity, you can reply whenever. I also added a few past projects in my signature. Totally fine to reply 'NO' if you'd rather not get future emails.\n\nFaithfully,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",

We help businesses like your's show what they mean; especially when it’s the kind of thing that’s tricky to summarize in one sentence.\n\nIf it takes three paragraphs to explain what you do at Practical PM, then it’s probably time for a video. We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nThis might be easier to show than tell; happy to put a no-cost sample together if you’re up for it.\n\nYou’re free to ignore this, but if you're at all interested, reply anytime. A few past projects are mentioned below in my signature. Just say 'NO' if you'd prefer no future messages.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",

If not interested, replying “NO” will stop future messages.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",

We build those from scratch with all the add-ons: clean, clear, and with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nIf you’re into it, I could draft a small script or storyboard to show how this might work for you.\n\nReply anytime if it feels like something you’d want to chat more about. You’ll see some past examples of our work in my signature. Totally fine to reply 'NO' if not.\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nTrusted by consultants, coaches, and businesses who care about clarity.",

  "email 1": "Hey Siraj, If this email is one of 200 you've gotten today, I’ll make mine short.\n\nI’m Trent. I make short videos at a studio called Toon Theory. Think whiteboard sketches with a background voice; simple tools for telling stories that are anything but simple.\n\nWe’ve helped others businesses like Shasha Consulting untangle the hard-to-summarize parts of their work. These videos let you show how all the dots connect; and we handle every part of the process so you don't even have to lift a finger.\n\nTeams often plug them into their homepage, newsletters, or even client onboarding kits. These videos are super dynamic.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to see how this could sound for Shasha Consulting; happy to whip up a quick teaser, 10 seconds or so.\n\nIf you're curious at all, feel free to reply. There’s some previous work listed in my signature. And if this isn’t for you, just reply 'NO'.\n\nBest wishes,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nAnimation for experts who need to sound less 'expert-y'.",
  "email 2": "Hey Siraj,\n\nI wanted to briefly follow up to see if the idea of a quick, low-lift sketch might interest you.\n\nThese kinds of animations are used to clarify big-picture strategies, improve training content, or explain services in a more human way.\n\nIf Shasha Consulting has something complex or critical to explain, I’d love to put together a sample to show what it might look like.\n\nReply when ready, and check out some past examples mentioned below. Or simply reply “NO” if you'd like to opt out.\n\nRegards,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",
  "email 3": "Hi Siraj,\n\nJust following up again because I think animation could add real value to Shasha Consulting’s messaging.\n\nIt’s an engaging way to capture attention and explain what makes your business stand out.\n\nIf it sounds useful, I’d be glad to prepare a quick teaser or script to show you what’s possible.\n\nYou can reply anytime, and our portfolio is in my signature.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",

We draw whiteboard videos to simplify what people usually need more than one paragraph to explain.\n\nWith so many bundled offerings and tailored services like the ones St. James Financial Services provides, it’s easy for prospects to miss the point. We make videos that connect those dots instantly, and we handle everything in-house so you don't even have to lift a finger.\n\nThey’re short, hand-drawn, and easy to reuse anywhere you need to explain what you do. They’re not fancy or high-budget; just a simple way to say something once and use it everywhere.\n\nIf you want to see what this might look like for St. James Financial Services, I could whip up a quick snippet, say 10 seconds. Absolutely no strings\n\nIf any part of this felt interesting, you can always reply. Some previous projects are listed in the signature. Or reply 'NO' and I won’t send anything else.\n\nTake care,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",

A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Restorex Disaster Restoration who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nThey’re built once, but tend to get reused in all kinds of conversations; such as your homepage, newsletters or pitch decks.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I could put together a quick sketch or sample script; just something to see if the tone feels right.\n\nReply anytime if you're even a little interested; and feel free to check out some previous work in my signature.

We make short, hand-drawn videos: usually for small teams with a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\nIf explaining everything you offer at Pallan & Associates CPA takes more than a minute, then you're probably doing it wrong and even *losing* customers. A video can help, and we’ll take care of every piece of it so you don’t even have to move a muscle.A lot of businesses like Pallan & Associates CPA who offer multi-layered services struggle with the *'how do we explain this?'* problem. That’s where we come in. One short video often does the trick, and the best part is that we handle all the moving parts with zero effort on your end.\n\nOnce you’ve got one of these videos, you can drop it into all sorts of places such as your homepage or even newsletters where words fail to keep up.\n\nNo pressure at all; I can put together a tiny demo if it helps spark ideas.\n\nReply anytime if you're even a little interested; and feel free to check out some previous work in my signature.

That’s what we do: clear videos that explain it all, zero lift on your side.\n\nThey’re built once, but tend to get reused in all kinds of conversations; such as your homepage, newsletters or pitch decks.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to see how this could sound for Beaton &; happy to whip up a quick teaser, 10 seconds or so.\n\nIf any part of this felt interesting, you can always reply.

  "email 1": "Hi there Sean, I’ve got a weird idea that might actually help.\n\nI’m Trent and I run an animation studio called Toon Theory. We don’t do flashy — just clear, human videos that help small B2B teams say more with less.\n\nWe’ve worked with teams like Vidcruiter who have a lot going on: layered offers, custom solutions, you name it. Our videos help connect the dots without adding more work to your plate. That's because we do it all in-house, with minimal effort on your end.\n\nTeams often plug them into their homepage, newsletters, or even client onboarding kits. These videos are super dynamic.\n\nTotally optional, but I’d be glad to send over a first-pass sketch. Just to play around with.\n\nIf this sparks even a bit of curiosity, you can reply whenever. I also added a few past projects in my signature. Totally fine to reply 'NO' if you'd rather not get future emails.\n\nBest wishes,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nAnimation for experts who need to sound less 'expert-y'.",
  "email 2": "Hello Sean,\n\nHope this finds you well. I’m following up on my previous note offering a quick, no-commitment demo to show how whiteboard animation might work for Vidcruiter.\n\nThese animations are a great way to explain services or products in an engaging, easy-to-understand format.\n\nIf you’d like me to put something together, just let me know. Some past examples are listed below too. Otherwise, feel free to reply “NO” if you’re not interested.\n\nWarmly,\nTrent — Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nWhiteboard videos your customers will actually remember.",
  "email 3": "Hello Sean,\n\nI am still happy to share a quick sketch or demo if it is helpful. Many of our clients use animation to break down services, explain strategy, or walk users through dashboards and pages.\n\nIf Vidcruiter has anything you are trying to simplify, I would love to help you explore it. Just reply if you want me to send something over.\n\nYou will also find examples of past work in my signature below.\n\nFaithfully,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nExplainers that turn confusion into conversion.",

We draw whiteboard videos to simplify what people usually need more than one paragraph to explain.\n\nWith so many bundled offerings and tailored services like the ones Huntt Group Canada provides, it’s easy for prospects to miss the point. We make videos that connect those dots instantly, and we handle everything in-house so you don't even have to lift a finger.\n\nThese videos tend to stick around; folks re-use them in demos, sales decks, or even when onboarding new hires\n\nLet me know if you’d like to see how this could sound for Huntt Group Canada; happy to whip up a quick teaser, 10 seconds or so.\n\nReply anytime if it feels like something you’d want to chat more about. You’ll see some past examples of our work in my signature. Totally fine to reply 'NO' if not.\n\nYours truly,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nAnimation for experts who need to sound less 'expert-y'.",
  "email 2": "Hi GEORGE,\n\nJust checking in one more time.\n\nI understand if now’s not ideal, but I still think there’s value in exploring how a short whiteboard video could help Huntt Group Canada communicate more clearly.\n\nIt could be a great fit for onboarding, product overviews, or thought leadership; and I’d be happy to show you a no-cost sample.\n\nYou can reply any time, or check out some of our past work in my signature. Or just send a quick “NO” if you’re not looking to explore this.\n\nRegards,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://www.toontheory.com\nThe explainer video partner for thoughtful, service-based brands.",
  "email 3": "Hey GEORGE,\n\nIf you are still considering creative ways to showcase Huntt Group Canada's value offerings, animated storytelling could be the missing piece of the puzzle to accelerate those conversions.\n\nI would be happy to send over a short visual teaser to get the ideas flowing.\n\nNo pressure, just a creative option to keep in mind.

We draw whiteboard videos to simplify what people usually need more than one paragraph to explain.\n\nI know Barton Consulting delivers bundled services that aren’t easy to summarize in one email or pitch deck. Even smart prospects can tune out if things aren’t quite framed right. These videos fix that. Our explainers do that job in under two minutes, with zero input needed on your end.\n\nMost teams keep reusing them. They're really helpful on landing pages, in follow-ups, or even onboarding flows.\n\nIf you’re into it, I could draft a small script or storyboard to show how this might work for you.\n\nNo rush; reply if you're even slightly interested. You can take a peek at what we’ve done before in my signature.
