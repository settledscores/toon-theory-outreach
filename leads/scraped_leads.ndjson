If not interested, replying “NO” will stop future messages.\n\nBest wishes,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nAnimation for experts who need to sound less 'expert-y'.",
  "email 3": "Hi Stephen,\n\nI’m checking in one last time about the opportunity to use whiteboard animation at SF Tax and Advisory Services.\n\nMany teams find that even short animations help simplify their message and make content more digestible.\n\nIf you’d like, I can put together a brief teaser or script to help you explore this option.\n\nPlease feel free to reply at any time. Examples of our work are in my signature.\n\nWarmly,\nTrent — Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nWhiteboard videos your customers will actually remember.",
