Patients in Need Since 2002, we ve treated more than 4.8M patients in underserved communities. 82% of these patients are enrolled in either Medicaid or their state CHIP program. The number of children not visiting the dentist or going to hospital ERs for dental related issues nationally tells us too many of them lack the primary care they need to prevent serious dental issues. Because these health issues can impact children s ability to perform their best in school and live a successful life, we are dedicated to supporting our communities.

Additional Savings Tax Planning Session Tax Planning Session Customers who sign-up for tax planning will save 25% on tax preparation fees. We want to make sure that we help you see the savings through! FAQs Tax Planning Session FAQs Want to know what the process is like? See our FAQ! FAQs FAQs Frequently Asked Questions What should I expect in a Tax Planning Session? Clients should expect two meetings and some homework during the tax planning phase. The first meeting will be an overview of the process, the outline of the tasks, and an agreement to move forward. This is followed by a working session where we review last year's taxes, current year financial results, current year financial forecasts (or provide some guestimates). Often we can provide a questionnaire that the client can fill out in advance that will make the working session go faster. Then finally, we will prepare and present expected savinigs along with an implementatiion plan for making those savings happen. How much time should I plan on this? That's a good question. However, the real question is how much time is $10,000 or more in saviings worth to you? We typically say that clients should expect between 5 and 10 hours to complete the process as inputs to the preparation of the plan. If we save you $10,000 (often a lot more) and you spent 10 hours working on it - that would be $1,000 an hour! What if there are no significant savings? Every client worries that there will be no savings. It is rare and it does happen. If we can't find any savings, then there is no charge for the review. Its that simple. Are the savings a one-time saving? Sometimes yes, but often they are recurring annually - which means they re-occur every. Clients love finding annual savings - its like giving them a pay raise! Is this confidential? Absolutely. We are fearce about protecting our clients and their condifentiality. We treat you the way we expect to be treated.

Program | DMR Accounting & Consulting Yet, discussions about finance and accounting often bring up feelings of shame and embarrassment. Avoiding your QuickBooks or accounting software? Or don t even use any? Feel like you re faking it with your financials? Too embarrassed to ask money questions because it seems like the answer is obvious, or maybe you will get an answer you don t like? SAY YES! TO YOUR SUCCESS Y our E mpowered S uccess Y ear-round E ntrepreneurial S upport Now is your opportunity to push past the bogus thoughts that you are not smart enough to understand your business' finances. KNOW YOUR NUMBERS Your financial numbers impact your profits. Do you know the most important numbers that every emerging and growing business owner needs to know? Understanding the story behind your numbers can make or break your business long-term success. SEE OPPORTUNITIES You may be missing opportunities to expand and grow your business. Do you know what is possible when you can confidently share your numbers with potential partners, bankers, and investors? DISCOVER PROBLEMS FASTER It might surprise you to learn how many business owners are secretly intimidated by their accounting and finances! About 20% of small businesses fail in their first year and 50% fail in their fifth year. Of those who fail, about 29% were due to running out of cash. (Source: CB Insights) The further along you are, the harder it can be to admit what you don t know! IDENTIFY YOUR DIRECTION You can predict the future of your business by using your finances. Do you know what actions make a difference for your business profits? Deidra Ryan , founder of DMR Accounting & Consulting and Fearless Accounting, is on a mission to demystify accounting and replace embarrassed and intimidated with confident and empowered when it comes to your personal and small business finances. Before working with Deidra, many of her clients avoided looking at their numbers, either consciously or unconsciously. They were afraid of asking the hard questions because the answer might be no! No to their big plans or no to their dreams. No to the business they worked so hard to build! Deidra s approach freed them of these fears and opened up new opportunities to feel empowered by their own accounting and finances. SUPPORT FOR FEARLESS ENTREPRENEURS The first step is always to get the basics cleaned up, streamlined, and systematized.

You can rely on Deidra s knowledge, expertise, and integrity to guide you in managing your business financial future. Set a spending plan for improving your business While traditional accounting work is priced at an hourly rate, this program gives you the freedom of knowing exactly what to expect. Rather than be surprised at the end of the month, you can predict and budget the cost of working on your business to grow and improve. Trust us , investing in yourself will be one of the best things you will ever do! THIS PROGRAM IS NOT A Set it and Forget it approach to accounting. It is a structure for supporting you to handle your own accounting work. A DFY (Done For You) solution. While DMR Accounting offers bookkeeping services, that is not what this program is about.

Will Rogers Subscribe to our Emailed Newsletter Austin, TX CPA : Accounting, Tax Planning & Payroll Estate Tax Planning Estate Tax Planning Estate planning on your own can be complicated and costly. And the list is endless... state taxes, bureaucracy, probate courts, unfair appraisals, health care concerns, eligibility of heirs, life insurance, annuities, burial or cremation costs, and intent regarding death-postponing treatment to name a few. Not knowing your legal and financial rights often ends up costing you more in the end. Thoughts of estate planning often bring more questions than answers: Could an heir be too young to inherit? Should the inheritance be given at a certain age? Is the intended beneficiary in a shaky marriage with divorce as a possibility? Are there children from a previous marriage? Should inheritance be protected from potential creditors of the heir? Are there taxes that can be avoided? Are you able to avoid the probate court rules, delays, and costs? Planning what happens to your estate when you're gone can seem frustrating and intimidating without qualified help. You may feel that you're too young to care about estate planning. Or, perhaps the reminder of death makes you uncomfortable. You might be tempted to put the whole thing off, assuming that it will just take care of itself. In all cases, estate planning ends up saving your family lots of time, heartache and money. And we can help. Every estate planning situation is different. In order to help you, we want to know you, your unique situation, and the nature of your relationships. We offer discussion, recommendations and useful research tools to make your planning simple, efficient, and worry-free. We are available throughout the process for further discussion regarding questions, change of circumstances, and alternatives. At every step, we'll be there with you. We help you... Clearly define your estate planning goals. Organize and create your estate planning team (experts on law, finance, and taxes) if you need one. Evaluate and recommend estate planning options. Prepare, organize and review your estate planning documents including current wills, trusts, health care and power of attorney. Decrease the problems and expenses associated with probate. Lessen taxes at time of death. Arrange for management of your estate in the event you are incapacitated. Draft a working plan for conserving and effectively managing your estate after death. Transfer the assets of your estate to heirs the way you want. Organize fair and adequate liquidation of estate to cover taxes and other expenses. Amend your plan as needed. You also get help with... Living Wills and Trusts. Lifetime Family Wealth Transfers. Family partnerships and other business relationships. Leaving money to charities. Preparation for estate and trust tax problems. The hassles and red tape associated with estate planning can be daunting, but you don't need to do it alone. Our team is waiting to assist you through every step of the process.

Will Rogers Subscribe to our Emailed Newsletter Austin, TX CPA : Accounting, Tax Planning & Payroll Small Business Accounting Small Business Accounting As a small business owner you have more important things to do than to keep your own books. We take care of your books for you, so you can get back to the job of running your business and generating profits! Each month or quarter we'll do the following things for you... Reconcile your bank account Clean up your general ledger Provide unlimited consultations These tasks form the solid foundation of your small business accounting system. You can customize the package of services you receive by adding payroll, tax planning, tax preparation, or any of our other services. Bank Reconciliation Reconciling your business checking account each month allow us to keep your bank account, accounting, and taxes up-to-date. Having us reconcile your account each month allows you to... Identify lost checks, lost deposits and unauthorized wire transactions. Detect and prevent excess/unjustified bank charges and ensures transactions are posted correctly by your bank. Detect and prevent embezzlement of funds from within your company. Know how your business is doing? You can't really know unless all accounts are reconciled and properly accounted for on your financial statement. Manage your cash more effectively. Proper management of funds not only saves money, it makes money for you. Protect yourself. By timely reconciling and promptly objecting to your bank about any unauthorized, fraudulent or forged checks presented to your bank and paid by that bank, you can relieve your agency of responsibility for the shortfall and transfer the risk to the bank. This reason to reconcile alone should be enough. Crime exists. Sleep Better. You will sleep more peacefully at night knowing your bank accounts are reconciled, in balance and that all escrow funds, accounts, checks and disbursed funds are properly accounted for. Maintaining a Clean General Ledger The general ledger is the core of your company's financial records. These records constitute the central \"books\" of your system. Since every transaction flows through the general ledger, a problem with your general ledger throws off all your books. Having us review your general ledger system each month allows us to hunt down any discrepancies such as double billings or any unrecorded payments. Then we'll fix the discrepancies so your books are always accurate and kept in tip top shape. Unlimited Consultations We are always available to spend time with you so you fully understand how to interpret and utilize the financial information we provide. Our consultations are already included in our price, so please feel free to call us whenever you have a question or concern.

Order your copy today in paper back or Kindle version on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Later-Lessons-Ron-Jackson/dp/B08KBQS94P What reviews say \"This was an excellent read. It s like having an intriguing discussion with two of your best friends after sharing a meal you all cooked together. It s familiar and warm. Guaranteed you will see yourself (and your friends/family) in love relationships that could have used these bits of wisdom and reflections from beginning to end. I really like the exploration of being evenly yoked culturally. It plays a big part in understanding one s intrinsic values and if cohesion/compromise isn t valued at the beginning...incompatibility is going to show up. This was a well-written, first book from a couple you can tell has a mature love and true friendship. It s honest and endearing. Hoping for more titles to come as they journey through life. Grab your loved one, teens or young adult children, family members or friends and read this one together. Should make for some interesting discoveries\". -Reader - Aniki https://www.amazon.com/Later-Lessons-Ron-Jackson/dp/B08KBQS94P Product bottom of page",

Get Started Automotive Industry We designed, developed, and implemented a process to convert an engineer-focused Method of Manufacturing ( MOM ) to a shop floor-optimized MOM and reverse. This solution was designed to accommodate MOM revision after the start of production and with existing labor reporting. Savings include: 24 hours of reoccurring manual engineering reduced to approximately 54 seconds. Structural Manufacturing Our client manufactures-to-spec CAD-designed mezzanines for industrial centers (Amazon, Target, etc). We designed an integration to break down the CAD BOM into a list of shippable components on the Sales Order, then generated a list of tracked jobs for progressive shipment and onsite assembly. Approximately 440 detailer man-hours per week. Component Distribution High-volume shipments of visually similar components serving multiple industries caused our client to have an approximate 17% shipping error rate. By implementing an inventory control system through training, labeling, and process reinforcement, we reduced the shipping error rate to 2.5% in the first month, and it is now approximately .25%. 85% improvement in shipping accuracy in the first month with improved customer relations. Between 10k-15k dollars in corrective shipping charges monthly.

Mason Our clients are a diverse group that come to us with a wide range of problems we help them solve. Below are just a sampling of the situations we've provided solutions for, actions taken and results achieved. INCREASED FUNDING Situation: A social enterprise focused on recruiting and retaining teachers of color did not have a robust strategic plan with clear goals, metrics and actions. This critical gap negatively impacted outcomes and funding. Action taken: We worked with the client to identify their key focus areas and core processes. We also developed goals, objectives, metrics, and actions. The new strategic plan was overhauled to drive results. Result: The client's new two-year strategic plan enabled them to secure multiple six figure grants and additional funding through the RFP process. SCHEDULE YOUR SESSION TODAY! PRIORITIZATION IS KEY Situation: A program provider for urban youth treated most tasks with equal priority, resulting in a staff that was stretched and stressed out. Action taken: The Optimist strategist worked with the client to create customized tools for project tracking and process mapping for the client s major programs. The strategist also created tools for managing unexpected stakeholder project requests. Result: The staff can now track program milestones and better prioritize their work. The tools used have improved communication within the organization and communication with community stakeholders, as well as reduced the stress felt by the staff members. INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY & EFFICIENCY Situation: The project management firm's procurement process was taking far too long. Once an agreement was reached with a new client, it was taking the organization a long time to complete and sign the contract. Action: The Optimist strategist worked with the client s team to map out the contracting process. This allowed the team to identify opportunities to eliminate unnecessary steps and to execute other steps in parallel. The future-state map created by Optimist for the client revealed an opportunity to go from a 49% process efficiency to a 77% process efficiency. Result: The Client is already seeing the benefits of a more efficient formal process for completing and approving contracts. 40% INCREASE IN CLOSURE RATE = SATISFIED CLIENTS Situation: This woman-owned marketing firm has recently experienced a significant decline in its client closure rate (the finalizing of a contract after proposal submission), and they didn t know why. Action: The Optimist strategist worked with the firm s leadership team to apply six sigma strategies for obtaining customer feedback and identifying root causes for the decline. Result: The firm responded to the customer feedback by adding another touchpoint to the contract closing process to hear and address client concerns. The client closure rate increased by 40%. OVERWHELMED WITH DATA Situation: The leader of an educational institution was overwhelmed with data. With 1000+ data points, a plan was needed for data analysis and an action plan was needed to address themes. The institution's limited capacity and competing priorities were prohibitive",

So many Americans end up in a situation where they owe more to the IRS than they can afford. Many people end up with LARGE debts to the IRS and do not get IRS debt forgiveness. The IRS is the world s most powerful collection agency. If you are in this situation, they can do some terrifying things like take your home, empty your bank accounts, garnish your wages, and many other things that no other collection agency can do. Your options often look something like this: pay the amount in full, or, pay it back over time with high interest and penalties. There is another option! Tax Relief May Be The Best Option We have a three-phase tax relief program that shows better results than any other firm in the industry. This is how we do it: Consultation phase - Free consultation Investigation phase - Investigate the problems and relieve any temporary headaches Resolution phase - Prepare you for any IRS Debt Forgiveness Programs with the best possible outcome and prevent any future headaches And the best part is we LOVE doing this. We are real human beings, who enjoy helping other human beings when they are most in need of relief. So if you re worried, overwhelmed, or stressed, and don t know what to do, today.

Here are eight methods to help you remedy your tax issues. Installment Contract If you find yourself unable to meet your tax obligations due to financial constraints, you may consider applying for a status known as Currently Not Collectible (CNC). This designation informs the IRS that, at present, you lack the means to settle your tax liabilities. It s imperative to include thorough documentation demonstrating your financial incapacity to repay the debts; failure to do so could result in denial of your request 2. Installment Agreement for Partial Payment If you re unable to manage a short-term tax installment plan, you have the option to negotiate for a partial payment installment arrangement. This allows you to make payments in smaller increments over time. It s important to note that there s usually a maximum timeframe of around ten years for such arrangements. Given the unconventional nature of this payment method and the importance of maintaining a positive relationship with the IRS, consulting with your settlement and resolution officer is advisable to avoid potential IRS assessments. 3. At this time, not collectible If you re burdened with a significant backlog of unpaid taxes, opting for an installment agreement can help you divide the amount into more manageable payments. This approach simplifies the process and alleviates the stress associated with making a large lump-sum payment. By establishing a monthly payment schedule, you can effectively manage your tax obligations over time. 4. Innocent Spouse You can prevent the transfer of tax liability from one spouse to another by filing as an innocent spouse. It s unjust for one spouse to bear responsibility for the other s tax debt, particularly if it predates the marriage. Filing as an innocent spouse provides a means to protect yourself from undue financial burden in such circumstances. 5. In-Compromise Offer If you re unable to settle your entire tax liability due to financial constraints, you have the option to submit an Offer in Compromise (OIC) form. This form notifies the IRS that, while you re willing to pay a reduced amount, you lack the means to pay the full tax bill. Similar to the CNC form, you must substantiate your inability to pay the debt in full with supporting documentation. Upon acceptance of the form, you re required to provide updated financial statements monthly. It s important to note that once your income surpasses the OIC cutoff, you ll be expected to resume paying the full amount. 6. Expired Returns Filing your tax return after the deadline can result in additional fees or interest assessments. However, you can swiftly address this issue by submitting a past-due return form. By doing so, you may qualify for a tax refund on any overpaid amounts, potentially providing additional savings. 7. Penalty Reduction If you ve incurred any type of tax penalty, you have the option to apply for an abatement to reduce or completely eliminate the fines.

I was well over $80,000 in debt and did not know where to turn. I worked with a different tax relief and after 3 years with no results I decided to try a different company. T&T Tax Relief got me compromises for both debts in under 6 months. I would recommend this services to anyone who is in need of professional help. Mr. Donald Albert Rebecca & Patrick Olsen My husband and I were in serious trouble and we did not see any way out. We were to the point where we were going to file bankruptcy because of our tax debt. We found Toledo & Toledo Tax Relief and learned about the services they could provide. As soon as we signed up, we were protected! The notices stopped coming in and the IRS informed us of the pending settlement with 4 weeks after signing up. To our surprise they were able to settle our $20,000 debt for $100. Curtis & Wendy Smith My problem started when I retired with my wife. I was under the assumption that taxes were being withheld from my retirement distributions but they were not. I let a few years go by and did not file my taxes. Well into our retirement we started to receive notices from the IRS, notifying that they had filed on my behalf and I owed them large sums of money. I had no way to pay what they were asking for. The IRS started to levy my Social Security benefits and we started falling behind on all our bills. After contacting these guys they made sure I was take care of. The following month's Social Security benefit was for the full amount. They were able to reach an agreement with the IRS for far less than what I owed. Thanks Toledo & Toledo Tax Relief! Michael Chepenick I started my own moving business but was too busy to keep up with my books and tax obligation and much less knew how to. Toledo & Toledo Tax Relief was able to explain how everything worked and got me started on a new path to running by business and staying current with my tax obligations.

FAQS Can I handle this on my own? While some people that owe a small amount to the IRS or State can work out payment plans or other solutions, most people find that they can t be successful in negotiating the best deal possible.

Choosing to address and resolve your tax issues is a significant decision, and it s natural to have reservations. While the decision is ultimately yours, it s crucial to recognize that delaying only makes resolving your tax debt more challenging. The longer you wait, the higher the likelihood of the IRS or State taking direct action, such as wage garnishment, property liens, or property seizure. I owe state income tax. Can you assist?

This being the first time getting my taxes done as an adult I was nervous and really had no idea where to start. After a couple minutes of being on the phone l felt confident that I made the right decision. They not only answered all my questions, as stupid as they may have been, but they also took the time to help me understand the process. I feel confident I got the best possible refund. They were also flexible to my somewhat crazy schedule. Thank you for such great service!

It is a great workspace and the people are amazing. Highly recommend this place for business owners, entrepreneurs, or anyone that needs a space to get work done. Steve Nomura United Vision Investment University CoWork has been great for my wealth management and financial investments firm. Located in Merrillville, Indiana, our second location was in downtown Chicago. We wanted a professional office with a more neighborhood feel that is accessible to our south side Chicago clients. When University CoWork opened last year, we immediately closed our expensive downtown office and got a $95 flexible membership, and then upgraded to a $295 dedicated desk. This allows us to do occasional work on the south side of Chicago. We now have a professional presence, and can meet our clients at our office closer to where they work and live. I love the phone and meeting rooms. Great technology. We are able to offer our clients parking and coffee in our beautiful new space. Our firm also hosts investment events in the University CoWork boardroom, classroom, and event spaces. Sharon Mallory CEO, SDM Investments Every aspect of University CoWork is superb! Since moving to Woodlawn in 2007, I have searched for suitable local office space for my law firm. I was happy to learn about University CoWork last year and eager to see the space and its amenities. The private offices, co-working spaces and common areas were all thoughtfully designed and built with highest quality finishes. University CoWork also offers far more than just professional office space. University CoWork is a welcoming community that monthly hosts networking and small business development programs and other events. I feel fortunate to be part of this vibrant community and urge those looking for local office space to visit University CoWork. Andrea Vag Managing Attorney, Vag Law LLC David Lubin was key to my expansion from a Chicago design firm to a branded North American design firm. He helped me acquire national and international clients during the most difficult business environment since the Great Depression. University CoWork helped me maintain consistent work during the pandemic, even during a pandemic construction depression in our territory. He propelled me to engage remote workers in the U.S. and abroad to keep my business growing despite the severe shortage of labor in the Chicago area. As other service businesses contracted, David s encouragement propelled me to leverage our tech stack, deep and unique subject matter expertise, and international contacts to prosper in uncertain times. Joel Berman Owner/Principal, Berman Architecture &. Design, Ltd. The warm and welcoming environment makes networking and getting involved easy. The amount of respect and support University Cowork has for its members and their businesses is impressive. I m very grateful to be apart of this establishment and work around really great and motivated people. Dr. Anancia Stafford Ed.D, LCPC, NCC Owner, Inner Peaces Counseling and Consulting LLC University CoWork is a state-of-the-art workspace that is designed to cover all of your business needs. If you want to have a conference room set up for Zoom meetings with all the latest technology they've got you covered. If you want to do a live video through social media, they have all the cameras, microphones, and various equipment needed to get the job done. Maybe you need a quiet professional setting to get some work done, no problem here. They have it all with amazing facilities and staff! Iris McBride Realtor, RE/MAX I moved my home based business into the University Cowork space several years ago and it was one of the best decisions of my life.

TESTIMONIALS UPCOMING CLASSES DEEP MAGIC GROUPS Testimonial of Kathleen McGarry Testimonial of Kayli Larkin Melissa Sandfort A Thousand Paths 0 My passion and purpose in life is self-transformation. Sometimes my life focus is difficult to communicate, as in the following conversation with my world-traveling brother-in-law: Naimish : So, do you like to travel? Melissa : No, not really but, I like inner travel. Naimish : You like interstate travel? You like to travel in the United States? Melissa : Ah, no, I like to travel inside myself, INNER travel, inner adventures. To the different states of being inside me. Naimish : Oh. My earliest method of inner travel was reading books, before I had any tools for making my way safely and meaningfully through my own interior landscape. I remember so vividly the despair I felt when Meg was being menaced by the It at the end of A Wrinkle In Time . It was the summer between 2nd and 3rd grade, and my 8 year old self just couldn t read a sentence more, but I wanted to find out what happened! My grandmother found me with tears streaming down my face, holding a yellow book with a centaur on the cover. She asked, What s wrong? I finished the book sitting in her lap, crying to the very end. Even then, I wanted the forces of individuality and autonomy to win over the forces of sameness and control. I travel inside myself, and love my job as an inner travel guide for others on their journeys, because I know that the more I and everyone else travels within, the more fiercely, joyfully unique we all become. We individuate. We find out who we really are. We grow up into who we were meant to be. I want to live in a world full of individuated, grown up people who are living profoundly meaningful lives with passion and vision! What I find so amazing about inner travel is you get all the benefits of world travel meet new people! make new friends! see fantastic new things! without the hassle of cabs and airplanes, PLUS you strip away layers of inner defenses and psychological burdens at the same time. You get to leave some of your baggage behind, and become an authentically more powerful human being as a result. Every inner journey benefits the traveler, whether the outcome is wisdom, power, clarity, or simply a growing sense of confidence in one s ability to navigate the inner landscape. I love to accrue the benefits of self-travel: an expanded understanding of my own humanity and a deep, felt sense of my shared sisterhood and brotherhood with the people who live in the worlds within us all. We all have hurt little kids inside us, and inner critics, and nervous parts, and shame, and fear and loneliness and the longing to love and be loved we are all the same inside. Through my inner travels, I continue to connect more deeply to this truth. I continue to expand my capacity to love myself and to love others, and to help other people expand their capacity to love themselves and to love others. Melissa Love is the natural outcome of peering under the foundations of personality and meeting frightening beings in cobwebby places who end up becoming tender new friends. Virginia Woolf E. M. Forster said of Virginia Woolf, a great explorer of consciousness, that she gave acute pleasure in new ways, she pushed the light of the English language a little further against darkness. To bring light to darkness, to make friends with things that were feared, that were strangers; to be always accruing more light, more love: that is the life of the inner traveler. It is the life for me, the only life I can imagine living, and I m ecstatic to share the insights and joys of it with other fellow travelers, for a short stretch of the path, or a long one. In whatever way this website supports your journey, I m honored to be traveling with you, even if I never meet you. I know that every one of us strengthens all of us. I m glad you re here.

Term Loans If you are looking for a longer period, term loans are a great option. We offer term loans with a maturity of 1 to 5 years and a total loan amount of $ 20,000 to $2,000,000. Unlike traditional bank loans, there is no unnecessary paperwork and approval takes hours instead of weeks. Apply Now ! Consolidation Have existing debt or balances? In many cases, we're able to consolidate all your existing debt into one entity - reducing your financial burden and saving you money in the process. Apply Now ! Debt Relief Instead of paying the creditors, you pay monthly on your behalf to a special savings account under your control. Once the funds have accumulated, our partners will contact your creditors to negotiate and agree on a reduction in your balance. You then authorize them to use the funds in your private savings account to pay your creditors a reduced amount. When accounts are paid, they should be reported as zero balance. This should help your credit score recover. The faster you save, the less debt you will have. Apply Now ! Equipment Financing Buy new or used equipment for virtually every industry. Lower rates, larger amounts, longer terms, fast and easy process. Get the equipment you need to grow your business. Apply Now ! Invoice Factoring It can take anywhere from 30 to 90 days for most businesses to receive payments from their customers, which is a long time when you have immediate business needs and employees to pay. Factoring will pay you most of the invoiced amount immediately, then collect payment directly from your customers. Therefore, for those businesses an invoice factoring program would make the most sense so they may receive quick access to funds to meet those business needs. Apply Now ! Asset Based Financing Asset-based loans allow a company to access working capital through a loan secured by the company's assets. This means that in this type of loan, the lender is secured by the assets (or multiple assets) held by the borrower of the business. Ultimately, this allows for lower interest rates, as this type of financing is considered less risky than unsecured loans. It is important to note that the more liquid a business asset is, the lower the risk of a loan and the lower interest rates may be. Apply Now !

Save Money On Your Investments Cost Segregation It is important to know what goes into Cost Segregation Studies. Engineering-Based Cost Segregation is the IRS-approved method for accelerating building depreciation for commercial and residential rental properties. A proper Engineering-Based Cost Segregation study identifies what should be correctly classified as tangible personal property or land improvements rather than real property, depreciated over 39 years (or 27.5 years for residential rental property). This means that all types of investment properties may qualify for a cost segregation study. Our Cost Segregation Process A High Level Overview We send you a proposal, and you approve it. We gather information on the property. A cost segregation specialist will conduct a site visit. We do all take-offs and costing. We assemble and deliver the final detailed report. Engineering-Based Vs. Residual Studies Our engineering-based cost segregation studies are far better than the residual studies most other companies perform. See What Makes Us Different! We go the extra mile for our clients by providing complete detail for both the short-life and long-life building components. This offers multiple benefits: It allows for the reconciliation of all project costs, as required by the IRS, keeping you safe in the event of an audit. It gives our clients and tax professionals the ability to track and retire short and long-life building components that are removed from service. Your tax benefits begin in the first tax year and continue throughout the identified assets depreciable life. As long as you own your property, an M&E Cost Segregation Study will continue to provide tax benefits every time a building component is replaced/taken out of service. Find Out How You Can Save on Your Taxes With M&E Cost Segregation Get a no-cost, no-obligation estimate to start your cost segregation study journey! Request a Proposal Our Engineers have completed thousands of cost segregation studies in countless situations. New Acquisition Studies/Purchase Price Allocations Suppose you recently purchased or are planning to purchase an existing property. In that case, we can help make your new acquisition more affordable by conducting an Engineering Based Cost Segregation study for the property. This will enable specific building components to be reclassified as tangible personal property or land improvements that can be depreciated over 5, 7, or 15 years rather than real property that is depreciated over 39 years (27.5 years for residential rental property). Due to the shorter recovery periods and accelerated depreciation methods, items reclassified as tangible personal property and land improvements generate faster depreciation write-offs, thus increasing your cash flow. Our Cost Segregation experts will also assign a depreciable life and a project cost to every component within the property. This will give you the ability to write off short and long-life assets that are retired in the years following the study. New Construction Studies No matter what phase you are at with your new construction project, it is beneficial to conduct an Engineering-Based Cost Segregation Study to minimize taxes and maximize ROI. Contact us today. Look-Back Studies Even if you purchased your property several years ago, you still have the ability to conduct a cost segregation study and receive the benefits of your investment in the current tax year. It can be greatly beneficial if you have owned the property for ten years or less. Leasehold Improvement Studies An Engineering Based Cost Segregation Study can be incredibly beneficial if you lease your space but have made leasehold improvements of $500,000 or more (or plan to in the future). M&E Cost Segregation can conduct an initial evaluation based on some basic information and prepare a cost vs. benefit analysis to lay out the expected tax benefits and the fixed fees required to complete the study. Then you can make an educated decision on whether to go forward with the analysis. Have You Replaced Any Structural Components of Your Building? If so, you could substantially benefit from an Asset Retirement Study.

Our clients call us first in the following scenarios: Interim Executive Staffing: Your CFO or Controller position is open and you don t have the capacity to absorb the work. Many companies have an internal person step in to fill the position who then becomes disillusioned when they are not selected as the final candidate. Your finance team lead has a medical leave. Organizations tend to spread the work around, creating stress on the organization and on the individual on leave. Call Veritae for a seasoned accounting or finance executive to manage daily responsibilities while you execute a thoughtful hire or need additional coverage through a medical leave. Project Services: You are acquiring a company and have not done this before. Your CPA firm can t help with the accounting for the transaction, as it is a conflict of interest. You are experiencing rapid growth. Your CFO or Controller may not have the experience to handle some of the financing issues of expansion. You are building a new facility and moving the company a new venture for your organization. You are installing new software and you need a Project Lead to manage the selection and implementation. You are undertaking a revenue recognition review in preparation for new guidance issued by the FASB and IASB, and need a seasoned person to manage and lead the project. Call Veritae for a senior level Project Manager or seasoned GAAP expert to mentor and lead your staff, adding depth and knowledge during important transitions. Giving Philosophy Veritae Group Menu Veritae s Giving Philosophy Veritae embraces the \"Go Giver\" business model - \"start by giving and success will follow\" (Burg & Mann). Simply put, it's not so much what we do but how we do it that differentiates us...such as: Giving one third of our operating profits back to our consultants and local charities, an annual commitment. Making investments in people, not brick and mortar, passing along savings to clients through lower than average mark-ups . Openly sharing our network to those in transition, at no cost to clients should they hire our referral. Retaining loyal, top notch talent by offering unique benefits - such as SIMPLE IRA with maximum match, loyalty bonuses, charitable matching, access to season tickets, and above market pay.

Building community through involvement with numerous Boards, charitable focused events and networking forums with executive leaders and peers. Thanks to you, and others like you, who appreciate a \"people focused\" approach, we are growing faster than we ever expected.

Bookkeeping As a business owner, you have a lot on your plate. Your most important goal each day is to ensure the business is operating effectively. We understand that this focus on operations can take your attention away from accounting matters. It s not unusual for a start-up or small business to lack expertise in this area, making the task even more challenging. However, it is critically important to ensure your bookkeeping and accounting records are accurate, from day one of business. Some entities are required to comply with certain accounting standards and principles. Failure to do so can result in costly errors and, in some cases, a lack of compliance with federal regulations. In addition, a failure to prepare and update accounting records can put the business at risk for the occurrence of fraud. Bookkeeping Services We provide full scale bookkeeping and accounting services to our clients. A few of these services are noted below. Custom Accounting Reports Often, owners and other stakeholders need to see financial and accounting information in a format outside the typical financial statements. We can provide custom reports to facilitate management decision-making. The reports are only as accurate as the data entered. This emphasizes the importance of account reconciliation noted above.

Click here to go directly to the contact form What People Are Saying Client Reviews My experience with Justin Sundberg started a couple of years ago when I needed an Estate Tax return done in a time crunch situation. With very short notice, Justin was able to have it done prior to the needed date. Since that time I ve discuss business situations/the tax implications thereof with Justin and had tax returns, both personal and estate, done by him. I like the fact that he does his research well, if there is any question and/or options available, he takes the time and effort to verify the correct options and then fully explain them to you. Justin has the skill of listening, a skill that I ve found not all accountants have, and a trait that I find critical if one is going to discuss complicated financial matters. I ve found Justin reliable, thoughtful, timely, accurate and very professional as I trust you will also. | Source George E. | Executive & Venture Capitalist (but a private person, so off the grid) Justin has been such a godsend. Between starting a small business in 2009 and getting married, my tax situation was complicated. He found errors on my 2009 return, amended it, AND found a way to accelerate some overhead expenses to increase my deductions. He has saved me and my husband a LOT of money and is always looking for ways that I can improve my bookkeeping. I also like his paperless capabilities, as we can send tax documents electronically and securely. If you want a responsive, well-qualified CPA who provides high quality work for a fair price, call Justin! | Source Dr. Barb Kaiser | Doctor of chiropractic, focused on neurospinal correction Working with Justin is always an informative experience. He is committed to sharing his knowledge, money-saving business tips, and expertise as a way of supporting his clients, prospective clients, and his peers. In an otherwise \"dry\" field of work, Justin has a way of providing tough information in a light, fun way. I enjoy Justin's professionalism and depend on his deep knowledge of the tax system. | Source KimAileen White, MA | HR Support | Customized Outplacement | Job Transition Justin is my go-to CPA for start-up and small business needs. He should be yours as well. Justin is as personable as he is professional. I recommend Justin to friends and family without hesitation. | Source David J. Holt | Healthcare & Business Attorney | Patient Advocate | Entrepreneur | Cofounder at miVoyce.com Justin Sundberg, at Sundberg Tax and Consulting, provides excellent professional services. I have been impressed with Justin's depth of expertise and knowledge regarding small business finances and tax preparation. Furthermore, Justin combines that expertise with his strong drive for customer service and warm people skills. As a client, Justin built my knowledge-base, put me at ease, and gave me clear directions and responses to quickly address complicated issues. Justin's top notch service, genuine and kind personality and his work ethic have earned my loyalty and my recommendation. | Source Jo Miller, GPC, CSMS | Grant Professional Certified - Federal Grants and Nonprofit Consultant We hired Justin to help with our business Taxes last year and Justin brought a wealth of experience to the table. He was extremely responsive about all our questions, took his time to understand our needs, and made a huge effort to make sure we were happy with the process. We highly recommend his work and will continue to use his services! | Source Fuyei Xaykaothao | Associate Director of Programming Development and Partnerships at Saint Paul Urban Tennis Justin is a fantastic accountant who has taken so much stress out of running my own business. I rely on him for sound accounting advice and direction. He's incredibly knowledgeable and trustworthy. And he's fun to work with - how often do you hear that about an accountant?? HIGHLY recommend him! | Source Jennifer Dunn | Experienced Realtor and Public Policy Consultant/Researcher I was referred to Justin to help settle an IRS dispute. Hiring him has paid dividends over and over. Not only did he save me 50% on the five digit tax bill, but he also reviewed and cleaned up all my previous years returns, restructured my business to an S-Corp, and now he takes care of my book keeping and payroll. Justin listens to your needs and goals and is knowledgeable and a wide variety of business and tax topics. If you are looking for a long term business relationship with a CPA, I cannot recommend him highly enough. | Source David Dressen | Entrepreneur Click here to go directly to the contact form To Be More Available to Our Clients Multiple Locations Downtown Minneapolis | Sixth Street in Capella Tower Web | Maps | FB Bloomington | 494 & 34th Ave Web | Maps | FB Minnetonka Web | Maps | FB North Loop Minneapolis | Washington Ave & 3rd Ave N Web | Maps | FB Saint Louis Park | West End Web | Maps | FB Edina | 494 & France Web | Maps | FB Saint Paul, MN 55104 | This is our administrative HQ, but it is setup to work and train our professionals, but not meet clients.

Michael D'Amato , CPA LinkedIn Recommendation Michael and Alto CPA Group, LLC. has provided Virtual accounting, tax, and cloud solution consulting to my Arizona based business for almost 1 year and I have been consistently impressed with Michael's attitude, productivity, and advice during this time. Michael is both very bright and motivated to provide value and has gone beyond providing the minimum amount of work. Michael has a clever way of streamlining processes and finds alternative ways to drive increased efficiencies. Although my business has grown over 70% over the previous year, Michael played an instrumental role in increasing my margin rate through leveraging techniques I could never have imagined pulling off, especially with so much growth in revenue. Michael helped manage almost every P&L item and also cut the average # of days on outstanding receivables with a unique way of analyzing payment patterns by individual customers rather than days outstanding across all customers.

Paired with our income tax preparation services, we provide a comprehensive approach to preserving your wealth for the future. CONTACT US TODAY CONTACT US TODAY Estate, Trust, & Will Planning What is an Estate? All the property that a person owns is part of his or her estate. Your estate includes everything you own, less all of your liabilities. An estate can include a house, the land the house is built on, cash, bank accounts, retirement accounts, stocks, bonds, clothes, jewelry, tools, cars, musical instruments, and other items. What is Estate Planning? The American Bar Association defines Estate Planning as: A process involving the counsel of professional advisors who are familiar with your goals and concerns, your assets and how they are owned, and your family structure. It can involve the services of a variety of professionals, including your lawyer, accountant, financial planner, life insurance advisor, banker and broker. Estate planning covers the transfer of property at death as well as a variety of other personal matters that may or may not involve tax planning. The core document most often associated with this process is your will. Do I need an estate plan? Many people believe that estate planning is for those who are reaching the end of their life or only after death. This cannot be further from the truth. Estate planning really begins as soon as you have an estate. While they have good intentions, some people make terrible mistakes when proper planning is not done. Some of these mistakes include leaving all of their assets to their husband or wife, improperly titling real estate, not taking advantage of the gifting rules and allowances as provided by the IRS, and not naming the correct beneficiaries on their life insurance policy. The Basics One of the first things that you should do is define your goals and choose the various professionals to assist you in gathering the information and begin to put the plan together. Estate planning is not just about what happens after you die. A good estate plan will also protect you if you become incapable of handling your own affairs. A good estate plan will let you, not the courts, keep control of your assets and decisions about your medical care when you can no longer handle your own affairs. When do you begin estate planning? Most people need to plan out their estate at some point. The only time that you can prepare and implement an estate plan is while you are alive and you are capable of entering into a contract. There's no guarantee you'll have time down the road. What is a trust? A trust is an agreement between a person that owns certain assets and another person who will take care of or administer the assets (called a trustee). The trustee would take the position of its owner and make decisions on behalf of the owner. Should a trust be part of my estate planning? The drafting of the trust document is a very important function. It should completely cover your wishes regarding distribution of your property. The trust document may be used to protect your heirs by giving them rental or purchase rights to property. It can specify the price and terms of an asset purchase. It is important to formally transfer all assets to the trust. Most assets can be transferred into the trust without adverse tax consequences, but if you have some unusual assets, you should check out the tax effects. Why are trusts created? There are many types of trusts that a person could create, each designed for a specific purpose. Estate planning is a major reason for creating trusts. Avoiding probate is another major reason to create a trust. Trusts aren t just for the wealthy There are many reasons why on",

What We Do We Support Innovation Virtual Accounting Services Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Financial Controller Bookkeeper Virtual Accounting Services Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Financial Controller Bookkeeper Scroll Professional Virtual Bookkeeper | CFO Strategies LLC (855) 732-7861 Bookkeeper The scope of a bookkeeper, whether it is an in-person or a virtual bookkeeping position, can vary widely based on the client s needs and budget. For example, what works well for an insurance brokerage company may not be a good fit for an architectural firm. Bookkeeper Responsibilities Below are some tasks that may fall within a bookkeeper s duties. Recording invoices to be paid Making payments Generating and recording sales invoices Collections Making and recording deposits Administering and processing payroll Reconciling bank statements Creating and posting journal entries for all financial transactions Filing source documents Preparing financial reports , including cash flows Filing certain tax returns, such as payroll taxes and sales tax Bookkeeping services are provided on a schedule agreed to with the client and could be on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the client s needs. All services are customized and tailored to the needs of the clients. The most successful relationship is based on regular communication, where expectations are established and met or exceeded. Bookkeeping Benefits In today s workplace, most companies work in automated environments that facilitate or enable working remotely. As such, there is a greater demand for professionals that can work remotely or virtually. A virtual bookkeeper offers the same services and benefits you would expect from a bookkeeper working on-site. The virtual bookkeeper would obtain access to the company s systems, applications, and files remotely, perform the same tasks and deliver the same reports as when working on-site. The key to success is maintaining regular communication. Ultimately, there is no difference in the benefits a company will realize from the bookkeeper. By entering an independent contractor arrangement, employers reduce payroll taxes, insurance premiums, and other costs associated with having a full-time employee on the payroll. Many businesses need for a bookkeeper can be cyclical, so this arrangement can allow the business to ramp up the bookkeeper s workload during busy times and ease off during slower times. Further, it is common these days for staff to turn over frequently, often within 1-3 years, which is disruptive to an organization. Engaging an outside firm like CFO Strategies to handle your bookkeeping protects your company against staff turnover and the disruption and cost of starting over with a new bookkeeper. From the virtual bookkeeper s perspective, this structure can allow them to serve multiple companies anywhere in the country, giving them more knowledge of various systems and practices. Outsourcing your bookkeeping needs can provide a level of expertise that can otherwise be hard to get. Virtual bookkeeping firms and bookkeepers for hire often have quite a bit of experience in many different industries. Finding someone locally who can provide that level of expertise while staying within the client s payroll budget may be a challenge. Businesses don t need to provide office space, a laptop, or other supplies to the virtual bookkeeper. Virtual bookkeepers have flexible schedules as long as specific tasks are completed by the assigned deadline. Things to Consider Before Hiring A Bookkeeper Because virtual bookkeeping requires the bookkeeper to have remote access to your business s critical financial documents, data security is essential. It may be necessary to strengthen your network firewalls and other protections before you allow your virtual bookkeeper access to this sensitive information. You may also require the bookkeeper to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). This provides your organization with some protection against the disclosure of its private data. The average annual income for bookkeepers is approximately $60,000 . This can vary based on location, the volume and complexity of transactions, and the bookkeeper s experience. If this figure is well beyond your organization s budget, it may be worthwhile to look into ",

Socials: bottom of page Finding A Good Accountant | Staten Island NY | Marocola Elite Solutions Inc top of page Finding a Good Accountant Who Understands Your Business While there is no shortage of accountants in the world, not all accountants are created equal. Every business is different, and you need to be sure that your accountant properly understands the needs of your business if you want to be successful. Outsourcing your bookkeeping is a big risk. You can t do everything by yourself and at some point, you ll likely need a professional to manage your books so you can focus on more important matters. But you can trust just anyone with that responsibility. Here are a few tips on finding a good accountant who will help you succeed: Find an accountant who understands your industry: Every industry is different and not all accountants are fit to understand the nuances of every business. An accountant with experience primarily in real estate may not be the best to handle a restaurant and vice versa. It s important to look for a tax professional with experience in your industry or at least an understanding of what is needed. Find an accountant who understands your tax needs: No two businesses are the same and to find a good accountant you ll have to know what kinds of tax services you need. If you are a company with 50 employees, you will need an accountant who understands payroll tax. If you re a solopreneur who travels extensively, you will need someone adept at tracking expenses and calculating possible deductions. You will likely need a variety of services from your accountant and it s best to have a handle on what you need before seeking out a professional. Find an accountant you trust on a personal level: You don t have to be best friends, but it s important to find an accountant you feel you can trust. You should at very least have a good report with your CPA because you ll be communicating with them a lot. If you have to grit your teeth every time you make a phone call, it s wise to look for someone else. Finding a good accountant when outsourcing your bookkeeping is tough, but not impossible. Give us a call at Marocola Elite Solutions if you want to expedite the process and book a consultation with a team of accountants who will check all these boxes. bottom of page Small Business Accountant Near Me | Staten Island NY | Marocola Elite Solutions top of page Small Business Accountant Near Me The Best Small Business Accountant Near You Proper accounting is vital to the success of any business.

There are six main steps in the home loan process. 1. Pre-qualification: We gather information about your credit, income, and assets to make a financial determination about how much house you may be able to afford. If you are refinancing the loan on your existing home, then the pre-qualification process should help you decide whether refinancing will help meet your financial goals. At this time, we will discuss various fees and down payment options. 2. Application: Once you find a home to purchase or determine you would like to refinance a current property, you will complete a mortgage application for a customized loan program and supply all of the required documentation for underwriting.

Once the underwriter initially approves the loan, our processors will work with you to meet all requirements for final loan approval. Read More 4. Processing: Hunter Lending will order the appraisal (if needed), title, and homeowners insurance and compile the other items required to move the loan to close 5.

Overview About Flock Homes Compare & Contrast Flock's Portfolio Transaction Process Client Experience Overview What is Flock Homes? Founded in 2020, Flock Homes is a real estate company and fund operator empowering landlords to exit from their rental properties through the 721 exchange. Through Flock Homes, real estate investors can use the 721 exchange to exchange their single-family, duplex, triplex, or quadplex rental properties for ownership in Flock s fund without triggering capital gains taxes. While in Flock s fund, investors benefit from continued access to steady cash flow and residential real estate appreciation, without any responsibilities of managing rental properties. Where did the 721 exchange originate? 721 exchange refers to Section 721 of the US Internal Revenue Code, the same tax code that stipulates the commonly utilized Section 1031 (also known as the 1031 exchange). Section 721 was established in 1954 and has been used for decades by institutional investors to minimize taxes on real estate. Flock Homes has pioneered a platform that empowers individual landlords to access the same benefits of the 721 exchange. See our How It Works page for more details. Once I join Flock, do I still own my home? No. Once you join Flock, title of your homes is transferred over to the fund and you now own equity in Flock s diversified fund. As a result, you retain all of the benefits of real estate ownership, including access to cash flow and appreciation potential. However, you do not hold liability for managing any singular home. What kind of homes can I contribute to the Flock fund? Flock s fund accepts single-family, duplex, triplex, and fourplex rental homes. All rental homes that join Flock s fund must meet our financial return requirements. Homes with lower mortgage balances (generally, less than 50% of the home s value) are more likely to be accepted into the fund. To see if yours qualifies, click here to submit your rental home for an evaluation and our team will connect with you to discuss your valuation. How do I earn as a client of Flock s fund? With your ownership in Flock s fund, you have the ability to access cash flow from the rental income collected from the fund's portfolio of homes, and you continue benefitting from potential real estate appreciation based on the price performance of the homes in Flock's fund. You also transition into a fully passive approach to real estate investing, which has given Flock clients back countless hours of time and invaluable peace of mind. All operations of the homes in Flock s fund, including leasing, repairs, and even HOA payments are fully managed by our team of professionals. How does Flock help me minimize my taxes? The 721 exchange allows you to defer substantial capital gains and depreciation recapture taxes you might otherwise trigger in a traditional sale of property. Following the minimum hold period, you can also access greater cash flow quarterly and better control your tax liability by liquidating Flock equity over time. Finally, Flock equity also benefits from a step-up in tax basis upon inheritance ( read this for a detailed explanation on the step-up in basis ), which can provide your heirs significant tax savings when they choose to liquidate their equity. We recommend you consult with your tax advisor, attorney, and/or the IRS website to understand how Flock can complement your personalized tax planning. About Flock Homes What is the relationship between Flock Homes and Flock s fund? Flock Homes is the General Partner of Flock s fund (Flock Homes OP LP). In other words, Flock Homes acts as the manager of the fund, which is collectively owned by all of the investors who have contributed homes to the fund. What experience does the Flock Homes team have? The Flock Homes team encompasses decades of investment and management experience from the largest real estate institutions in the world, including J.P. Morgan, State Street Global Advisors, and Progress Residential, and has used their expertise to help 150+ landlords retire from real estate through Flock Homes. Learn more about the team here . What happens if Flock Homes goes bankrupt? Flock Homes, our company and General Partner of the Fund, is an independent entity separate from the Flock Fund, which holds the high-quality, income-generating assets collectively owned by clients (or, Limited Partners). This structure ensures that the Fund can continue operating as long as a fund administrator is in place. In the unlikely event that Flock Homes goes bankrupt, and to future-proof client wealth, Flock has entered into an agreement with Roofstock, a leading single-family rental (SFR) platform that manages 25,000+ homes across 35+ markets, to act as a standby servicer to the Fund. While Roofstock is not formally responsible for management today and does not have any management authority, Flock s arrangement engages Roofstock to become versed in the Fund s operations and assets, including the Fund s tax-driven execution and administration of 721 Exchanges. In the event there is a need to transition management of the Fund from Flock, Roofstock will, subject to the requisite approvals, be in a position to seamlessly integrate into the role of Fund Manager. What is Flock s historical performance? Flock has met or exceeded its cash return target to investors every quarter since inception. You can see our most recent Quarterly Fact Sheet for detailed performance figures here. Is Flock registered with the SEC? Yes. While Flock's Fund is not currently subject to full SEC registration requirements due to an applicable exemption, Flock is nevertheless regulated by the SEC and subject to the rules for private fund advisors. Flock also files a Form D annually. You can find our filings on the SEC s website . Compare & Contrast What is the difference between the 721 exchange and the 1031 exchange? Many real estate investors utilize the 1031 exchange to sell their home for proceeds, and use those proceeds, tax-deferred, to purchase other investment real estate. With Flock Homes, investors can use the 721 exchange to seamlessly exchange their homes, tax-deferred, for direct ownership in Flock s managed real estate fund. With a 1031 exchange, investors commonly continue to",

The issues involved in healthcare valuation are driven by a complex regulatory environment, highly varied reimbursement models, and unique operating structures. Failure to understand these details can have a huge financial impact, and we believe our clients deserve valuation advisors who are laser-focused on this space. Call (888) 464-8175 or contact us online today. Healthcare Business Valuation Services Business valuation determines the overall economic value of an organization or its specific assets. This process employs methodologies like the income approach (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis), market approach (examining comparable transactions), or asset-based approach. Key factors influencing business valuation in healthcare include: Revenue streams Payer mix Operational efficiency Regulatory compliance Market competitiveness For instance, a valuation might assess how hospital-specific metrics such as bed utilization rates and specialty services influence profitability and overall worth. Your goals matter to us. At Root Partners, we work directly with our clients valuation needs to ensure their business transactions run as smoothly as possible.

Continue Reading Read Less Do What's Right We believe in honesty and integrity, stewardship and accountability to our clients, our staff, and the communities we serve. Solution-Oriented We help clients find objective, defensible solutions for transactions and financial arrangements involving the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute. Constant Learning We maintain deep expertise through ongoing education, research, and active involvement in healthcare trade organizations. People First We prioritize the human element in everything we do, acting with kindness, respect, and appreciation in our interactions. Compensation Valuation Services Compensation valuation assesses whether a healthcare provider's pay aligns with FMV and commercial reasonableness. This is often essential for compliance with laws such as the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute, which regulate financial relationships between providers and referral sources. Compensation valuation analyzes provider productivity data, regional benchmarks, and industry standards. It involves metrics like total work relative value units (wRVUs) for physicians, collections, and hours worked. For example, ensuring a physician s salary for a medical director role complies with FMV helps safeguard against legal risks and promotes ethical practices. Defensible Solutions for Evolving Compensation Models Aligning physicians and other healthcare providers is vital to the success of healthcare organizations. With an ever-changing regulatory landscape and constantly evolving compensation models, it is critical to support compensation arrangements with well-reasoned, defensible, and actionable fair market value (FMV) opinions. At Root Partners we don t provide canned opinions or survey-based calculators. Instead, we work diligently to understand our client s alignment goals, the regulatory guardrails pertinent to the arrangement, and the true market-based value drivers underpinning the compensation arrangement. Most importantly, we work collaboratively to educate all parties involved to build consensus and facilitate a successful and compliant outcome. Fair Market Value in Clinical Compensation In an ever-changing regulatory and competitive environment, clinical compensation models should be continually evaluated to remain attractive to providers, commercially reasonable, and compliant. Root Partners does not take a one-size-fits-all approach to clinical compensation. Instead, we consider both quantitative and qualitative measures that truly drive fair market value. Clinical compensation engagements include : Physician and APP employment Professional services agreements (PSAs) Subsidies and stipends Call coverage Medical directorships Administrative Compensation Strategic alignment across the healthcare continuum is a driving force behind improved outcomes and reductions in the cost of care. With the ongoing evolution of payor models, value based enterprises, healthcare technologies, and novel services models, the need for innovative and dynamic valuation models has never been greater. At Root Partners , we pride ourselves on being a solution-driven appraisal firm providing defensible and well-reasoned FMV opinions across an ever-changing landscape of administrative pay models. Examples include: Physician executive and administrative pay Pay for performance and value-based compensation Management services agreements (MSAs) Clinical co-management and hospital quality and efficiency programs (HQEP) Care coordination and management Healthcare technology platforms / novel care delivery models Compliance Testing and Appraisal Review: Ongoing Support and Validation Keeping your compensation models consistent with FMV is an ongoing process. Root Partners is here to help, with ongoing testing and review processes that can help your organization proactively monitor compensation. Our objective is to ensure compliance before a problem arises. If your organization has received a healthcare valuation that doesn t quite seem right, we are here to personally review all the information and critique previous work. We want you to have a clear understanding of our opinion on the appraisal and our suggestions for your next steps. We work with clients across the United States from California to Texas to Florida who need a sound valuation of their practice. We are credentialed members of the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) in Business Valuation and the National Association of Certified Valuators and Analysts (CVA) in Business Valuation.

Given these concerns, markets have fallen, with the S&P 500 dropping more than 10% from its highs and into correction territory. The market declines can be unsettling; however from a planning perspective, declines in asset values can also present opportunities to employ planning strategies that could better position you and your financial strategy for long-term success. These strategies can be particularly beneficial for higher-net-worth individuals or those with potentially taxable estates, as they can help mitigate future estate or income taxes. Below we outline several planning strategies that may help you take advantage of these declines and turn your strategy from defense to offense. Gifting and Estate Tax Planning: If you intend to pass your assets to individual beneficiaries and you may be subject to estate tax, there are a number of strategies that could be particularly beneficial during a down market. In 2025, the annual gift exclusion is $19,000 per donee per donor, and the federal lifetime estate and gift tax exemption is $13.99 million per individual. Expectations are that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) will be extended in full or in part, but if no changes are made, the lifetime exemption will sunset at the end of 2025, meaning the exemption would fall from $13.99 to approximately $7 million, adjusted for inflation. Thus, some gifting* and estate-planning strategies could be particularly valuable and timely during a down market, allowing you to transfer assets when values are down, helping maximize the value of your gift and potentially reducing future estate taxes. This would include the following strategies: Gifting : Consider making gifts to individuals (or certain trusts for their benefit) up to the annual exclusion limit. And if you intend to use part or all of your gift tax exemption during your life, you may want to evaluate whether a down market may present an efficient time for such a gift. Transferring assets when values are down could allow you to either transfer more shares of investments within the annual exclusion amount or use less lifetime exemption for the gift. Trust Strategies : Similar to the gifting strategy, transferring assets to an irrevocable trust when asset values are down could allow you to transfer more shares/assets or use less of your lifetime exemption, while still removing the future appreciation of those assets from your estate. These strategies are most beneficial for individuals who have federal or state estate tax concerns and are interested in gifting assets to individual beneficiaries. Strategies including intentionally defective grantor trusts (IDGTs), spousal lifetime access trusts (SLATs), and grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs) present planning opportunities for assets with decreased values. Funding IDGTs and SLATs during a market downturn allows for more efficient use of your lifetime exemption. A GRAT would be primarily for individuals who anticipate federal estate tax liability and are interested in mitigating it by removing the appreciation of particular assets from their taxable estate. For example, if you have securities that have high growth potential, transferring them to a GRAT when asset values are down could remove some of the appreciation (and tax liability) from your estate during a recovery. However, assets that depreciate over the GRAT's term or assets without much growth are not efficient choices for funding, so this strategy requires careful consideration of the assets used to fund the GRAT. And if you plan to transfer assets to more remote generations, such as grandchildren, consider making those gifts using your generation skipping transfer (GST) tax exemption during the down market to help optimize your exemption allocation. Additional Tax-Planning Considerations: In addition to the estate-planning strategies above, there are additional strategies you could consider during a down market that could help with taxes and tax planning. Roth Conversions: When you convert assets from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, you pay income taxes on the value of the assets being converted, so it's important to note that a Roth conversion will result in an increase in taxes. That said, performing a Roth conversion when asset prices are depressed could reduce the amount you have to pay in taxes, as you would be converting a lower portfolio value. This could then provide an opportunity for tax-free growth in your Roth as asset values recover. Tax Loss Harvesting: While many people think about tax loss harvesting as something you do at the end of the year (when your overall tax liability may be clearer), you can tax loss harvest at any time. Recognizing capital losses could allow you to offset capital gains recognized throughout the year. Any excess capital losses are next used to reduce ordinary income by up to $3,000, with any remaining excess losses carried into future years to offset capital gains recognized in 2026 or later. This can also be a great opportunity if you find yourself needing to rebalance your portfolio. Taking Control of Your Strategy While none of us enjoy periods of market volatility, these fluctuations are a normal part of investing, and they can be used as an opportunity to better position your financial strategy for long-term success. Talk to your professional team, including your financial advisor, tax and legal professionals to see if the above strategies make sense for your situation. *Consult your tax professional before gifting assets with values below your cost basis, as it may be more efficient to recognize the loss before making the gift. Edward Jones, its employees and financial advisors cannot provide tax or legal advice. You should consult your attorney or qualified tax advisor regarding your situation.

I have a strong clean-up background and have proficiently turned messy books into clean, fully reconciled, better organized and easily readable financial statements for businesses including: legal, dental, med-spas, research & development tech start-ups, cleaning companies, e-commerce, food-trucks, trucking/logistics, non-profits, farms, flower shops, Real-Estate and Title companies, Design & Consultation firms, Landscaping and Home Services, Yoga, Art Studios, and more. I take pride in thoroughly documented and demonstrated journal entries, reconciliations, and workpapers so that all elements of your financials are proven and tie-back to source documentation. What this means for you is that there's concrete evidence for trusting your financials; and that our frequent conversations about your trajectories and landscape are heavily informed by my experience with other businesses' financials, which means you're not in it alone. We can implement best practices for almost any situation (examples: scope of work profitability tracking, payroll growth forecasting, grant-mapping) and we work from reports that speak about your business in the language you already think of it in.

Not everyone has the vision and drive required to successfully take a concept and bring it to life. And the thought of hiring external staff, like a bookkeeper, can feel a bit daunting. Early on, when you re just starting out, it s manageable to track everything yourself or use basic software. But as your business grows, you might find that managing all those invoices, payments, and expenses becomes overwhelming, explains Steven Kibbel, certified financial planner and founder of Kibbel Financial . I ve seen small business owners who wait too long to address this and end up with errors in their books, missing payments to vendors, or even misreporting revenue. SEE ALSO: The 20 best tools for starting your own business Sure, you might pride yourself on running a lean business, but a good bookkeeper should be seen as an investment, one that helps you track and retain more of your hard-earned money and frees up your time to focus on what you re best at. If you ve been wondering whether or not you need outside help to track and manage your small business expenses and income, you ll want to read on. Here are the tell-tale signs that it might be time to hire a bookkeeper, according to a certified financial planner and a small business tax advisor. 1. When you re unable to keep track of the inflow and outflow of cash As your business grows, managing your own books can quickly become overwhelming. You might lose track of who owes you money, miss vendor invoice deadlines, and struggle to accurately track cash flow, says Alex Cook, VP of Small Business Tax at Block Advisor . Reliable cash flow management is crucial for making informed business decisions that ensure long-term success. However, if bookkeeping isn't your strength, it can hinder your progress. According to Cook, untangling financial messes on your own can consume valuable time that could be better spent on sales and revenue generation. If this sounds familiar, it might be time to outsource your accounting to a trusted provider. 2. When bookkeeping starts eating into your time Another big trigger is when bookkeeping starts eating into the time you should be spending on running and growing your business. I worked with a client who owned a small retail shop, and she told me she was staying up until midnight every night trying to reconcile her accounts. That s time she could have spent sourcing new inventory or marketing her business, explains Kibbel. Hiring a book",

If something you hear sparks some interest on your part, I d love to know! Is This You? - Business Culture Consultants Is This You? I ve worked in a variety of industries, including retail, technology, hospitality, manufacturing, professional service providers, non-profit and financial institutions, and start-ups. In every engagement, I ensure we share these values: Integrity in the way business is done around finances, sales/marketing, and relationships. A recognition that there is no quick fix to changing patterns in the culture While it is important to get a sense of how the work will be done there s also a willingness to go into the unknown A sense of the business serving a higher purpose Most of my clients have the following criteria in common: FIVE TO FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES Revenues of $1.5mil or greater schedule a free consultation Commitment to a multiple bottom line business model While I customize my work for every client, there are some common scenarios I see come up again and again. Let s see if you recognize your organization in any of these Your staff is stressed out and you can t quite get to the root causes. Striking the balance between consistency and giving your employees autonomy has been hard to find. Shortly after trying solutions like offsite retreats or workshops your people fall back into old patterns. Meetings typically start late, agenda items aren t always all covered, and falling into rabbit holes is a common occurrence. You re still not where your organization should be in blending remote and in-person collaborations and cohesiveness. You are often inspired and have visions for the organization, but find your team is cynical toward new initiatives. You continuously set sales goals, only to fall short. Team members often feel stressed out, overwhelmed, and/or swept along. One of your star performers just gave notice, and you sense there is more to their story than pursuing other opportunities but aren t sure what that could be. You ve provided tons of training and online webinars, but there are still too many negative patterns of behavior. You have strong organizational values, however integrating them into everything you do still remains a challenge. Do any of these sound familiar? schedule a free consultation What I Don t Do Mandated Coaching: Coaching only works when individuals are ready for change. Just like the joke How many therapists does it take to change a lightbulb? Only one, but the lightbulb has to want to change. , clients must be self-motivated for real progress to happen. Continuing to Work Without Commitment: If leaders aren t upholding their commitments to the process, I won t continue to engage. Success requires consistent involvement and accountability from leadership, and I ve stepped away from relationships where this wasn t happening. Therapy: While my psychology background informs my work, coaching is distinct from therapy. If issues like anxiety or depression arise, I refer clients to specialized professionals, allowing us to keep our focus on organizational-related growth and transformation.

Make a Payment Client Portal Testimonials Newsletter Latest Edition Newsletter Archives Subscribe Contact Contact Request Appointment BOI Your Introduction to Green Apple Resources From the desk of Kim Perkins Founder and CEO of Green Apple Resources Thursday, 8:33am Dear business owner, If there s two things you take away from this site, let it be these: Your time is worth more than you realize. Accurate knowledge, regular review, and careful analysis of your financial situation affords you the best chance to help your business succeed on all levels. One of the many reasons small businesses fail is because of financial management issues. Most entrepreneurs don t get bookkeeping or financial help, and they pay for it in the end. By working with us, you can improve your efficiency, increase your chances of success, and concentrate on growing your business what you set out to do with your knowledge and experience in the first place. Like the fruits of any honest labor, Green Apple Resources developed from a single seed planted years ago. Then in 2004, I started a bookkeeping business called Books by the Numbers. As I worked over the years with small business owners, entrepreneurs and growing companies like my own across New Hampshire, I found their needs stretched beyond the financial realm. To meet those needs, I moved beyond Books by the Numbers to create Green Apple Resources. My vision is reflected in the new slogan, At the Core : To provide our clients with the administrative foundation necessary to run a business that not only survives, but thrives. With more than 15 years of experience across a diverse range of industries, the Green Apple mission is to provide full service bookkeeping, payroll services, office management, training and income tax preparation, with a focus on outstanding customer service. My team will work with your goals in mind (or help you create them), and do everything within our areas of expertise to help you achieve them. Thank you very much for your interest. I hope we ve made your time on this site a valuable investment. Best regards, Kim Perkins, EA P.S. We re so committed to helping business owners beat the financial management issues that put so many struggling professionals out of business, we offer a free, no obligation consultation to those ready to move forward with their vision and profits. Just contact us , and let us know when and where you d like to meet. You ve got nothing to lose, and everything to gain.

But so many small business owners become their own worst bosses! Most likely, the goal was never to work 50-80 hours per week. The Big Picture probably didn t involve you buried under To-Dos and Should ves, lost in a sea of unreconciled bank statements, unsent invoices, unfiled paperwork, and unending drudgery. It happens to virtually all entrepreneurs and small business owners about to take their success to the next level. To take the leap, you simply have to get smarter about your time and resources. Delegating. Building a team. Focusing on your high return-on-investment activities. These are the things you need to do, and you know this. But how?

Brian Royce Worker Royce Works, LLC 5.0 Based on 20 reviews powered by G o o g l e review us on Jack Coyne 20:54 17 Feb 25 Brian is amazing. Had a job for him right after a snow storm and he was there the same day! Fast and accurate, with honest pricing. Adam Crockett 13:55 14 Dec 24 Great experience Steven Vogl 14:42 27 Nov 24 You will never receive the level of service and attention to detail from anyone else that you will receive from Brian. And be prepared to be impressed by his progress and recap reports complete with pictures and detailed explanations. Can t go wrong! Jon C 17:51 18 Oct 24 I had a broken storm door with some rotted trim, and Brian Royce from Royceworks did an excellent job fixing everything. Not only did he install the new door perfectly, but he also cleaned up the area and replaced the old brickmold with durable, rot-free PVC molding. The new door looks exactly how I wanted, and Brian went above and beyond by taking a trip to the local hardware store to replace missing hardware from the original shipment. I really appreciated Brian's great communication throughout the process and, of course, his exceptional craftsmanship. If you're looking for someone responsive and reliable for carpentry or handyman work, I highly recommend Brian Royce! Mindy Perkins 00:02 05 Oct 24 We had a hot water tank leak, and the insulation under home needed to be replaced, as well as the underbelly. Brian was very open and upfront with the situation. He still did the job, because he said he would. He was very quick and efficient in completing the job, and came in under his initial quote. Brian went above and beyond to do the job for us, and we highly recommend him! Jessica Matt 00:27 16 Sep 24 Very dependable and showed great care in his work. He was thorough and attentive to my needs in multiple home repairs. He spent extra time making sure the job was correctly. He was always responsive in communication. If you're looking for a trustworthy carpenter, Royce Works is where to go. Andrea B 02:49 24 Jul 24 I highly recommend Brian if you need work done on your home. My mother and I called Brian after doing some research and seeing the great ratings he had. We had no idea if he'd be able to help us in general, let alone how quickly he did. We had a couple of projects that we desperetly needed to get done. First and for most for safety reasons and then because of how unappealing they were to look at. Brian called me back the same day. He then arranged a time to come the next day to speak with us and get a better idea on what was going on. He agreed to take on the projects and did so with a wonderful attitude. He also had help at times from a trusted associate (Todd) whom also was very knowledgeable and did great work. Part of one of the projects involved old wiring, updating and relocating some of that, and adding a couple power sources. Although he probably could've done it himself, he called on a trusted electrician to get the job done. So if there is something he may not feel the most comfortable doing he will tell you and he will find the proper help to do so. Then part way through one of the other projects, it ended up being more of a mess than anticipated. Despite that, Brian tried his best to stay on budget, keep our stress down, and reassured us that things will still get done as planned. Brian communicated everything thing with us the whole way through. Efficiently and professionally. He definitely takes pride in his work and is devoted in making his customers happy. He strides in making things as safe as possible; as if he were doing the work for his own family. And in making sure things look great! It is hard to trust a stranger with your property, time, and money and we have no regrets that we trusted Brian! We would definitely work with him again in the future! Alex Ebert 13:16 05 Jul 24 Thank you Royce Works for saving our aging deck. Brian went above and beyond when it came to bringing life back to our outside oasis!! Our deck was suffering from rotting infrastructure beams, and cosmetic boards and railings. He came right over, did an assessment and gave us an affordable price. Super hard worker, master carpentry skills, and super detailed. Very professional and very friendly guy. We were so pleased with his work we asked him to fix up some more projects around the house. Hope to work with you again in the near future! Thanks Brian! Jeff Zahner 11:10 29 Jun 24 Brian Royce recently rebuilt my entire deck. He originally gave me a price to just repair and replace rotted decking. After he arrived and re-evaluated he replaced every single deck board and the stairs. The work and craftsmanship was onpoint. He was clean and respectful of my property and did a fantastic job. On time and on budget. I would highly recommend his company and his services. I have several other projects that I plan on using Royce Works for. scott mcewan 17:03 09 Jun 24 Brian answered my add for construction help. He was very knowledgeable, owned all the needed tools and performed above my expectations. Would hire him again without question. Kaleigh Lewis 13:36 09 May 24 Brian and team was great! Super meticulous, went above and beyond in every way. His final report was detailed and extremely thorough, would absolutely hire him again! Kerry A. Chase 12:43 29 Apr 24 Brian did everything and more to repair a neglected porch at our rental property. Brian answered my email within hours and visited the next business day to scope out the work. He provided a detailed and clear proposal, with options and recommendations; he completed the work when he said he would; and he took tremendous care in all aspects of the job. Along the way, he was in regular communication and even sent photos. We couldn t have asked for more. Excellent work and workmanship! Cheryl Mahoney 19:48 30 Mar 24 Brian is a professional, reliable, and skilled carpenter. His work is high quality and we are very pleased with the 3 projects he has done for us. Communication was never an issue and he always got back to us quickly. We look forward to working with Brian on other projects. Lauren D 21:12 17 Feb 24 I wish I could give him 10 stars because his work is amazing and very detailed oriented! Brian is great at what he does and puts so much thought and detail into his projects! Brian helped me come up with ideas for our home I didn't even know I wanted, and they came out amazing! He is efficient and very thoughtful with his presence in our home, and around our family! I highly recommend Brian for any home improvements, tear downs, landscaping, carpentry , any home improvement I needed he was there and he has amazing woodworking skills! He has helped improve every room in our new home and couldn t thank him enough for all the hard work! He even completed jobs he doesn t advertise as work he does just because I needed help with it! Thank you Brian I can t wait for spring time so I can have you back for our new decks and landscaping!!10 Victoria Donaghy 19:39 16 Feb 24 Our 50+ year old, \"on the cheap\" garage needed a facelift. We hired Brian to install some trim, cedar shingles, remove two standard size windows and add five small cosmetic windows all to complement the house. Brian was fastidious and was satisfied with nothing short of perfection. We could not be happier with his work and will be having him reside a summer rental \"barn\" on our property as well as attend to a number of other \"aging\" issues wood homes experience. We highly recommend Brian and cannot praise the quality of his work enough. Jim Pinierio 15:06 11 Dec 23 Brian did tremendous work at my house. He completed two projects. First, was the installation of a ramp for a new shed. His attention to detail was apparent when, before the attachment, he discovered that the shed was not level. He took the time to level a very big shed resulting in a flushed and grounded ramp that looks great. The second project, challenged his creativity and problem solving skills! We have a standing seam metal roof with solar panels. Needless to say the snow comes crashing down from two levels, a Great Room roof that peaks at 20 feet and a second story roof line, onto shrubbery. Brian designed protectors that have folding legs for storage and can withstand anything coming of the roofs! I was impressed with the finished project and it exceeded all of my expectation. Again his attention to detail and communication on the phases he was in during development gave me security that I had made the right choice in hiring Brian. I emphatically rec",

If a business is to grow, it must grow people. Leadership development is an essential component of this process.

We use an experiential, self-directed learning process that allows participants to develop a plan of action that supports the organization s overall direction.

I'm the CEO of a small, but fast growing, company, and I had previously been taking care of our multi-state payroll myself. It was overwhelming and I did not have the necessary expertise. Christina from Valor stepped in and took our payroll over completely, including all of the multi-state tax filings and other reporting. She also fixed all of the mistakes I didn't even know I had made. She is kind, gracious, knowledgeable, attentive, and communicative. She has improved my company and has allowed us to continue growing. I would recommend Valor to any company with payroll needs. You will kick yourself for not doing it sooner. Tamara D. Christina Hageny did some early work for our company and we were so impressed with her level of knowledge, expertise and commitment to the project that we signed her on to manage our company's payroll full time. We deal in all 50 states and have employees spread out all over the country. As you can imagine, we brought a pretty complex set-up to the relationship, but Christina tackled it without any issue and got us back into compliance while ensuring that our team got compensated correctly and on time along the way. We do and will continue to recommend Christina Hageny and Valor Payroll Solutions to our friends and colleagues. Capable, trustworthy and unparallel customer service! Tony G. Highly highly recommend. Valor is extremely professional and quick to answer any of my questions. I love that I have the ability to input hours and I am able to add employees easily. Christina has been patient with my many many, often times duplicate questions as I have been learning. She has helped me gain better understanding when it comes to payroll. After paying employees over 4 years I feel like I have such a better handle & understanding of payroll than I ever have. Thanks to Christina and her team. 5 stars! Whitney V. We are a virtual organization with team members located all over the United States. Christina and her team have been amazing in helping us manage payroll and compliance for multiple states.

Accounting Services Accounting Services It s a fact: Working with a business advisor dramatically increases the odds of success for your business. And with 50% of businesses failing in their first five years (Source: SBA), it just makes good business sense to find ways to increase your chances of success with your business. Finding the Perfect Blend of Accounting Skills and Expertise Every business is different when it comes to the type and level of accounting services needed. Some small businesses may only need bookkeeping services, while others benefit from many layers of accounting skills from bookkeepers to Chief Financial Officers. If your business is in the small to mid-market range, it may not make sense to have a full-time CFO, a full-time controller, and multiple bookkeepers with all the full-time salaries and benefits in your accounting department. The good news is you can still get the advice of these high-level accounting skill sets while paying only for what you need. We work with business owners like you to create a customized package based on your company s unique accounting needs. How We Can Help Your Business Accounting System Selection Having the right accounting system can make all the difference in the world. We re familiar with many accounting software options and can help you find the best fit for your business. If you ve outgrown your current solution, we can help you manage the transition without missing a beat. One secret in boosting accounting productivity is to make sure your accounting software is set up and customized correctly. We learn your requirements so we can tailor the accounting software to your business and reporting needs. Plus, we can train your staff on the new system so they can be up and running in no time. Accounting System Selection, Setup, Customization and Training Workflow Efficiencies Streamlined data gathering and entry Process Development and Improvement The accounting function is necessary in every business, but it shouldn t be cumbersome or inefficient. We can take a look at areas within your accounting system that are costing you more than they should be. These could include areas of duplicate data entry, time spent on manual reports, and bottlenecks in general. We ll suggest improvements that can save you time and money and keep your bookkeeping bill as low as possible. Are there any areas in your accounting functions that are undocumented? We can help you write a procedures manual for those areas. Good documentation is the key to good training, consistency, and controls. Let Hughes Walker Group suggest efficiency recordkeeping workflows for some of these key elements of your business: Invoicing & sales receipts Expenses & expense reporting Payroll Accounting controls Profitability Analysis Do you wonder which product or service line is the most profitable for you? We can perform an analysis of profitability by location, product, employee, or whatever grouping is meaningful for you. This information will help you make better decisions about your revenue mix and make your business more profitable in the long term. While most accountants stick to cursory expense reviews, we prefer to go deeper. We can help you identify costs that may be outside your industry norms, discover areas where your pricing might not cover your costs, and root out profit margins that should be higher. If you maintain inventory in your business, we can help you lower carrying costs, determine out-of-stock conditions, and identify obsolete items. Is your business project-based with job costing requirements? We can help you make sure it s set up right, help you create more accurate estimates, and accelerate cash flow with timely progress billings. We go beyond traditional services by providing: Monthly financial reports (Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow) Regular business reviews (Either monthly, quarterly, or annual) Industry related key performance indicators to call attention to financial issues and inconsistencies Cash flow projections Loan package creation Budgeting and forecasting Profitability Analysis Committed to the Relationship It can be difficult to find advice when you are in business for yourself. As a fellow small business owner, we can act as a sounding board for your business ideas and provide a fresh, experienced perspective. We can serve as an unbiased listener for your ideas and concerns. There are so many benefits to hiring a bookkeeping company to take care of your books. Peace of mind Relief Better business insight Tax time is a little less taxing More profits Focus How to Get Started How to Get Started The perfect synergy between a business owner and the accounting team occurs when two things happen: 1) the team gains a deeper knowledge about your specific business, and 2) the business owner grows in their financial knowledge about their business. This is when the magic really starts to happen for the business, and it improves over time. Our goal is to become a true partner for your business by providing you with the right mix of accounting services for you and your business.

Our Story Eighty-One Eleven HR Consulting Services Our Story Passion. Integrity. Commitment. It s not just a number it s a legacy. 8111, not because that is the number of reasons why HR is important to your business, but because that s where it all began. Jenna is a 3rd generation entrepreneur following in the footsteps of both her father, Chris, and grandfather, Gene. 8111 Raytown Road is where Gene planted roots for his family and his business. He believed in building strong partnerships, providing the highest quality of work and investing in the betterment of others. He passed his legacy to Chris who worked hard to honor his father during the nearly 65 years of business that the company was open. In remembrance of her grandfather and the valuable lessons that she learned while visiting 8111 Raytown Road, Jenna (Henderson) Eschenbrenner, Owner/Founder of Eighty-One Eleven HR Consulting, strives to achieve the same core values that her grandfather once taught her.

Download Salary Survey Employers Guide to Managing AI in the Workplace This guide provides HR and legal considerations for employers to understand artificial intelligence (AI). Managing AI in the Workplace Our Members Include I attended the harassment prevention workshop put on by Employers Council, and I wanted to share my praise for the presenter. I was skeptical about whether I would learn anything I didn't already know, but she presented the information in thought-provoking and nuanced ways. She answered questions well and had us do an activity that enlivened the presentation. As an academic, I particularly appreciated the way that she was able to address the issues intellectually and not simply give us an \"information dump.\" Anyway, I was impressed with what I expected to be a boring presentation. - Professor, Regis University Professor - Regis University Our handbook needed to be updated. We had done minor revisions over the years, but more policies than we needed crept into the handbook over time. I wanted to keep what was important and get rid of the rest. I sent my handbook to Employers Council and staff went through all of the policies to first let me know what could be eliminated, and what needed to change in order to bring it up to date. The best thing was that this is part of my full membership dues, so there was no charge for this. I send in my handbook every one or two years for a tune up, so it reflects current laws and stays streamlined. Lynnette Siedschlaw, HR Director - Moffat County As I faced some difficult employee problems over the years, I knew that I could reach out to Employers Council and get some good solid advice in how to handle a situation. In the 20 years if have been working in HR I don t believe I was ever given bad advice. I may not have always agreed with what the counsel was, but I never put myself or the company in a compromising position by following your advice and recommendations. Joe Maylin, Human Resources Manager - Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. Being able to reach out to someone on the Member Experience Team when something comes up and we're just not sure how to handle it is amazing. We have help just a phone call or an email away, and everyone that we have worked with has been so responsive, understanding, and helpful.
