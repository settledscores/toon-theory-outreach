  "email 1": "Hi Stephen, Dropping in with something that might be useful (or at least mildly interesting.)\n\n\n\nI’m Trent. I run Toon Theory, it’s just a few of us drawing stories for people like you who don’t love PowerPoints.\n\n\n\nI know SF Tax and Advisory Services delivers bundled services that aren’t easy to summarize in one email or pitch deck. Even smart prospects can tune out if things aren’t quite framed right. These videos fix that. Our explainers do that job in under two minutes, with zero input needed on your end.\n\n\n\nMost teams keep reusing them; on websites, in follow-ups, or even onboarding flows.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want a quick visual mock; no deck, no pitch, just a sketch.\n\n\n\nIf you're curious at all, feel free to reply. There’s some previous work listed in my signature. And if this isn’t for you, just reply 'NO'.\n\n\n\nAll the best,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\nwww.toontheory.com\nTrusted by consultants, coaches, and businesses who care about clarity.",
  "email 2": "Hi Stephen,\n\nI know inboxes get full fast, so here's a quick follow up.\n\nWhiteboard storytelling might be a surprisingly effective way for SF Tax and Advisory Services to simplify something your audience or team needs to grasp quickly.\n\nIf you’re still open to it, I can send a short demo such as a sample script or 10-second sketch, just to give you a feel.\n\nLet me know, or feel free to check out some of our past work in the signature. And if you’re not interested, just reply “NO”.\n\nCheers,\nTrent — Toon Theory\nhttps://toontheory.com\nExplainer videos made to convert, not just impress.",
  "email 3": "Hi Stephen,\n\nI hope your week is going well. I am wrapping up some projects and wanted to reach out again before I close things out.\n\nIf you would still like to explore using whiteboard videos to support SF Tax and Advisory Services's messaging, I would love to help. Simply reply or take a peek at some of our previous work. It is in my signature.\n\nSincerely,\nTrent — Founder, Toon Theory\ntoontheory.com\nHelping you teach, pitch, and persuade in under two minutes.",
