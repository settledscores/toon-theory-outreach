    """{salutation} {name},

Hope your week’s going well. Just wanted to follow up on the note I sent a few days ago about Toon Theory.

I still think there’s potential to try out animated storytelling with one of your core offerings.

I’d still be more than happy to draft a script or sketch a ten-second demo to show what kind of potential this could have.

Feel free to reply if you're still curious to explore the fit. There’s a link to our site in my signature if you’d like to check out some of our past work.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

I figured I’d follow up on my previous note just in case it got buried.

I mentioned that we create animated explainers to help companies like yours simplify their messaging and stand out.

If you're open to it, I’d be happy to sketch a quick teaser or draft a sample script. Just a creative way to see what this could look like in action.

Feel free to reply if that sounds interesting. There's also a link to our site in my signature if you’d like to see some of our past work.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Just circling back in case this is still something worth exploring.

Animation can be a powerful way to bring clarity to complex ideas — we’ve seen it work well in a range of industries.

If you’d like to test the waters, I’d be glad to share a short sample tailored to your brand.

Feel free to reply any time. You’ll find a link to our past work in my signature.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Just wanted to check in again — we create whiteboard animations that help explain and differentiate brands more clearly.

Happy to sketch out a quick visual draft if you’re interested in seeing what it might look like for your team.

You’ll find a few past examples on our site (link in my signature). No pressure at all.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Hope you're doing well. I know inboxes fill up fast, so thought I'd try again.

If there's a message you're trying to simplify or a service you're trying to highlight, animation might be worth a look.

Let me know if you'd be open to seeing a visual draft or sample storyboard.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Just a quick nudge in case my last message got buried.

If you’re still exploring ways to communicate more clearly or creatively, I’d be happy to sketch a short explainer to show how this might work for your brand.

You’ll find a few samples in the link in my signature.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Hope your week’s going well.

I wanted to quickly follow up to see if you’re still exploring ways to make your messaging more engaging.

I’d be happy to sketch something short to help visualize what that might look like.

Let me know what you think.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Just following up in case this is still on your radar.

Animation’s helped a lot of our clients explain complex services and ideas in a simpler, more memorable way.

Would you be open to seeing a quick visual mockup?

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

I wanted to follow up on the note I sent recently about Toon Theory.

We help teams cut through the noise using short, story-driven animations. It could be a good fit if you’re looking for a new way to explain what you do.

Happy to draft something simple if you'd like.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

I know you’re probably swamped, but I thought I’d reach out again.

Animation has been really useful for clients looking to simplify their message and get noticed.

Let me know if you'd like a rough idea of what that could look like for your brand.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Just revisiting my earlier message. If now’s a better time to explore this, I’d love to reconnect.

We focus on creating short, compelling whiteboard animations that help companies express themselves better.

Happy to share a quick draft if that’s helpful.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

I wanted to give this one more shot in case it’s still a conversation worth having.

Animation might be a smart way to simplify something you’re already doing — whether it’s internal messaging or customer-facing content.

Let me know if you're interested.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Reaching out again to see if this might still be relevant.

If you’re curious what animation might look like for your message, I’d be glad to share a quick visual or sketch to start.

Just hit reply if you're open to it.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Circling back to see if a short animation might be something you’d like to explore.

Even a quick 10-second sketch can give you a sense of how it all works — especially for explaining services or onboarding processes.

Let me know if you’d like to see a mockup.

    """{salutation} {name},

Following up once more — we help brands explain themselves in a clear and engaging way using short, custom animations.
