PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You're helping a whiteboard animation studio write a cold outreach email.

Here is their base email:

Hi {name},

I‚Äôve been following {company} lately, and your ability to make {summary} really stood out.

I run Toon Theory, a whiteboard animation studio based in the UK. We create strategic, story-driven explainer videos that simplify complex ideas and boost engagement, especially for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.

With your focus on {angle}, I think there‚Äôs real potential to add a layer of visual storytelling that helps even more people ‚Äúget it‚Äù faster.

Our animations are fully done-for-you (script, voiceover, storyboard, everything) and often used by folks like you to:

- [Use case #1 tailored to website content]
- [Use case #2 tailored to website content]
- [Use case #3 tailored to website content]

If you're open to it, I‚Äôd love to draft a sample script or sketch out a short ten-second demo to demonstrate one of these use cases, all at no cost to you. Absolutely no pressure, just keen to see what this could look like with {company}'s voice behind it.

[Dynamic closer based on brand tone or mission. For example: ‚ÄúThanks for making data feel human, it‚Äôs genuinely refreshing.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúThanks for making healthcare more accessible, it's inspiring.‚Äù]

Warm regards,
