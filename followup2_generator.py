Just circling back in case the timing makes more sense now. I still believe whiteboard animation could simplify something {company} is working on ‚Äî a product, a process, or a pitch.

Happy to mock up a short demo or even draft a script. Totally no-strings ‚Äî just a creative way to explore the idea.

    """Hi {name},

Still happy to offer a quick sketch or sample if it‚Äôs helpful. A lot of our clients use whiteboard animation to break down services for new hires, investors, or even clients.

If {company} has anything you‚Äôre trying to simplify or visualize, I‚Äôd love to help.

Wanted to follow up again before I close the loop here.

If animation could help {company} clarify a message or show off a service, I‚Äôd be glad to create a short teaser. It‚Äôs a quick, visual way to get the conversation going ‚Äî no cost at all.

Not trying to spam you ‚Äî just wanted to keep the door open.

If {company} ever needs a clear, visual way to communicate something complex, I‚Äôd love to create a custom sketch or sample explainer.

I know inboxes get busy. Just offering one last check-in.

Animation‚Äôs a helpful tool when you need to simplify a process, explain a strategy, or just keep people‚Äôs attention. If {company} ever wants to give it a try, I‚Äôd be happy to share a short teaser.

Hope things are going well on your end,
