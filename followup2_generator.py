    """{salutation} {name},

Just circling back in case the timing makes more sense now. I still believe whiteboard animation could simplify something {company} is working on; whether that‚Äôs a pitch, process, or product.

If you‚Äôd like to test the waters, I‚Äôm happy to sketch something out to show what it might look like.

You‚Äôll find past examples linked in my signature.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Still happy to share a quick sketch or visual sample if it‚Äôs helpful. Many of our clients use animation to break down services, explain strategy, or walk users through a process.

If {company} has anything you‚Äôre trying to simplify, I‚Äôd love to help you explore it.

You‚Äôll find past examples in the signature below.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Thought I‚Äôd check in one last time.

If you're still curious what an explainer might look like for {company}, I‚Äôd be glad to share something rough; a short sketch, or script to get the ball rolling.

You can find our work in the link below.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Wanted to quickly follow up before I wrap things on my end.

Whiteboard animation is often a good fit for simplifying messaging, especially when you're trying to break through noise or explain something fast.

Let me know if you'd like to test an idea visually.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Just reaching out again before I archive this thread. If now‚Äôs a better time to try animation, I‚Äôd love to put something together.

Even a 10-second sketch can be a useful way to explore what‚Äôs possible.

Reply anytime.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

If you‚Äôre still considering new ways to share what {company} does, whiteboard storytelling could be a great tool.

I‚Äôd be happy to send over a short visual draft to get the ideas flowing.

No pressure; just a creative option to keep in mind.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Hope this isn‚Äôt too forward; I just really think there‚Äôs potential to show off what {company} does through animation.

If you'd like to see what that might look like, I‚Äôd be happy to sketch something out.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Circling back once more before I close the loop.

If there‚Äôs anything at {company} you‚Äôve been meaning to simplify, an animation could help bring that to life.

Happy to draft something visual if you'd like to see what that might look like.

{signature}""",

    """{salutation} {name},

Reaching out one last time. If you're still exploring creative ways to explain what you do, this might be a great fit.

I‚Äôd be glad to put together a simple teaser or sketch if you're curious.

Sometimes even a 10-second sketch can make a big difference when explaining something new.

I‚Äôd be happy to share one if you're interested in exploring animation for {company}.

Hope your week‚Äôs going okay. I‚Äôm wrapping up some projects and wanted to reach out again before I close things out.

If you'd still like to explore using video to share what {company} does, I‚Äôd love to help.

A quick follow-up before I close out my list. If now‚Äôs not the right time, no worries at all.

But if you‚Äôre curious about how animation might help {company}, I‚Äôm still open to sharing a quick visual idea.

No pressure at all; just following up to say I‚Äôd still be happy to sketch something for {company} if you're curious.

It could help simplify something you already offer, or clarify a new direction.

Whiteboard explainers are great for making complex ideas stick. If that‚Äôs something you‚Äôve been thinking about at {company}, I‚Äôd love to share a quick draft.
