    """Hi {name},

Just circling back in case the timing makes more sense now. I still believe whiteboard animation could simplify something {company} is working on: a product, a new launch, or a pitch.

Happy to mock up a short demo or even draft a script. Totally no-strings; just a creative way to explore the idea.

If it sounds worth exploring, feel free to reply. You‚Äôll find a link to our website in my signature if you‚Äôd like to take a peek at some of our recent projects.

    """Hey {name},

Still happy to offer a quick sketch or sample if it‚Äôs helpful. A lot of our clients use whiteboard animation to break down services for new hires, investors, or even clients.

If {company} has anything you‚Äôre trying to simplify or visualize, I‚Äôd love to help.

Reply anytime if this feels like a fit. There‚Äôs a link to our website in the signature if you‚Äôd like to see some examples of some of our previous work.

    """Hello {name},

Wanted to follow up again before I close the loop here.

If animation could help {company} break down the dense copy or show off an awesome new feature, I‚Äôd be glad to draft a script or create a short teaser. It‚Äôs a quick, visual way to get the conversation going; no cost at all.

    """Hi there {name},

I know inboxes get busy. Just offering one last check-in.

Animation‚Äôs a helpful tool when you need to simplify a process, explain a strategy, or just keep people‚Äôs attention.

If {company} ever wants to give it a try, I‚Äôd be happy to share a short teaser.
