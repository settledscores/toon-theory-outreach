Hi {name},

I‚Äôve been following {company} lately, {niche_summary} and your ability to make data feel approachable, and even fun, for small businesses {niche_summary} really struck a chord with me.

I run Toon Theory, a whiteboard animation studio based in the UK. We create strategic, story-driven explainer videos that simplify complex ideas and boost engagement, especially for B2B services, thought leadership, and data-driven education.

With your strong emphasis on {services} I think there‚Äôs real potential to add a layer of visual storytelling that helps even more business owners ‚Äúget it‚Äù faster.

Our animations are fully done-for-you (script, voiceover, storyboard, everything) and often used by folks like you to:

{bullets}

If you're open to it, I‚Äôd love to share a few tailored samples or sketch out what this could look like for {company}‚Äôs brand voice.

Thanks for making HR feel human ‚Äî it‚Äôs genuinely refreshing.

Warm regards,
